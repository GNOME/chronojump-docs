\end{comment}


For more information about Chronopic consult the web page: \url{http://chronojump.org/documents.html#hardware}

Current Chronopic version is Chronopic3 {\small{}(fig \ref{fig:Chronopic3}).}{\small \par}

\begin{figure}[h]
\noindent \begin{centering}
\includegraphics[width=250pt,height=188pt]{images/chronopic3}
\par\end{centering}

\caption{\label{fig:Chronopic3}Chronopic3.}
\end{figure}



\section{Chronopic connections}

Chronopic 3 is a USB powered hardware. Using USB cable it receives
data from PC and also power. To complete the connection, this cable
will also be connected to the socket.

Chronopic will be connected to the contact platform or photocell barrier
through the RCA connection\includegraphics[scale=0.03]{images/RCA_connector}
, the terminal block \includegraphics[scale=0.03]{images/screw_connector}
or both.

Using Chronopic RCA (and / or fuse) it is possible to connect 'n'
networking platforms to any Chronopic. This model is useful to chronometer
situations where an athlete should not be able to be in more than
one platform at the same time. Both cables of each platform must be
connected to the RCA connector or the terminal block.

Software allows the connection up to 4 Chronopics with an independent
signal, each connected to one or more sensing devices. This makes
possible chronometer independently various subjects, complex paces
or other applications. 


\section{Chronopic working process}

Chronopic detect changes in the contact platform and sends it to the
computer by USB cable, USB-serial or serials. You can also use the
test button \includegraphics[scale=0.03]{images/test_button} to simulate
changes in the platform.

Chronopic has a green light to indicate when the subject is on the
platform or the photoelectric barrier (light stays off) or outside
(light is on).


\section{\label{sub:Chronopic-puertos-USB}USB ports}

The operating system assigns names to ports, as shown in Table \ref{tab:Nombres-de-puerto-USB}.

\begin{table}[H]
\begin{centering}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|>{\centering}p{5cm}|>{\centering}p{4cm}|}
\hline 
Operating system & Port & Name & Comments\tabularnewline
\hline 
\hline 
MS Windows & USB & COM1, COM2, COM3, ... (seen to COM27) & Driver required\tabularnewline
\hline 
GNU/Linux & USB & \textbf{/dev/ttyUSB0}, /dev/ttyUSB1 & \tabularnewline
\hline 
\end{tabular}
\par\end{centering}

\caption{\label{tab:Nombres-de-puerto-USB}Names of each operating system port.}


\noindent \centering{}The most common names are in bold type text.
\end{table}


The use of the driver is explained in the next section.


\subsection{Windows USB Driver}

A driver is a small program that indicates the computer how to operate
a new device. 

Chronopic plate requires a driver to run on Windows. This driver is
automatically installed when you install any version later than Chronojump
0.7.

If you connect the Chronopic to the computer, and it\textquoteright s
detected \textquotedbl{}New hardware found\textquotedbl{}, then the
driver is not required, in other case it will be necessary to run
the driver.


\section{\label{sub:Modificaci=0000F3n-del-puerto}Modification port assigned
by Windows}

If the port assigned is COM5 or higher it may cause problems in some
computers detection. If this happen, it\textquoteright s recommended
to assign a lower port than COM5, preferably COM1 or COM2.

To manually assign a port, repeat the steps described in \ref{sub:Detecci=0000F3n-del-puerto}
to know which port is assigned, then do the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Click \textquotedbl{}Port Settings\textquotedbl{}.
\item Click on \textquotedbl{}Advanced Options\textquotedbl{}.
\item Select one of the ports COM1-4 (preferably COM1 or COM2).
\item Accept and close the assistant.
\item Disconnect the USB cable and reconnect it after a few seconds.
\end{enumerate}
At this point it should be assigned a COM port that device that will
last forever. Alternatively, return to perform the steps described
in \ref{sub:Detecci=0000F3n-del-puerto} to verify that the change
was made directly. 

En este momento ya debería tener el puerto COM asignado para siempre
a dicho dispositivo. Opcionalmente, si quiere puede comprobar que
el cambio se ha realizado directamente puede volver a realizar los
pasos descritos en \ref{sub:Detecci=0000F3n-del-puerto}.


\section{Chronopic solution problems}

In case of detection failure when changing Chronojump platform, we
propose the following battery of tests. If Chronopic is not working
after performing these tests, please noted at the Forum \url{http://foro.chronojump.org}.

Perform each of the tests until it\textquoteright s working correctly.
Remember to check that the cables are connected properly. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Power Problem: The red light will turn on when you connect the USB
cable (this will happen when the computer is turned on except when
there is a connected platform and someone stepping on it, or pushing
the test button \includegraphics[scale=0.03]{images/test_button}).
\item Problem networking platform: Connect the contact platform to Chronopic
and the Chronopic to the computer (no need to open chronojump)and
check the Chronopic by clicking on the platform and checking if the
light turns on and off. If the light doesn\textquoteright t turn on
and off, but it did in the previous step, then the cables are in touch
when they are connected to Chronopic. Insulate them, check if they
are poorly connected or if the platform has a bad contact (disassemble
and repair).
\item Port problem on Windows: If the contact platform doesn\textquoteright t
have any problem, unplug it and continue the testing only with the
Chronopic. Then, check if the port is detected and connect the cables
to the computer, the power should also be detected in the Chronopic
as described in Section \ref{sub:Detecci=0000F3n-del-puerto}. Windows
may detect more than one type of port COM, do the following test to
both. If the port assigned is higher than COM4, it\textquoteright s
recommended to modify the port to one less than COM4, preferably COM1
or COM2 as described in Section \ref{sub:Modificaci=0000F3n-del-puerto}.
\item Execute Chronojump, select the port configuration in the Chronopic
window. A dialog will appear asking you to click \textquotedbl{}OK\textquotedbl{}
and after this click on the button Chronopic, shortly Chronopic should
be detected and ready to be used with the platform connected if desired.
\end{enumerate}

\part{Using Chronojump}


\chapter{Using Chronojump}

When Chronojump is opened, a window will allow you to select the type
of tests you are gone to work with.

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{centering}
\includegraphics[width=1\columnwidth]{images/splash}
\par\end{centering}

\caption{\label{fig:splash}Chronojump splash screen.}
\end{figure}


Once you have selected, if you want to go back to this windows you
can go to \emph{Menu -> Mode: -> Main window}

You can also configure some parameters related to the automatic hardware
detection. If you experience problems at start or while capturing
try the different options.


\section{Chronojump main window}

When chronojump is opened you will be asked the mode you want to work
with. Chronojump has 4 modes and in each one there is a lot of diferent
tests. 

Figure \ref{fig:Ventana-principal-de} shows Chronojump main window.
This is divided into the following parts:
\begin{description}
\item [{The~menu}] where you find the access to session and help.
\item [{Edit~subject}] provides a quick access to individual operations.
\item [{Subject~selection}] where you can select the subject and edit
it with the menu that appears when you click on the right button of
the mouse.
\item [{Chart~selected~test}] If there is a drawing of the test selected
or targeted by the mouse, it will be shown. Also, if the program has
expanded information on the test, displays an icon to indicate it.
By pressing this button it will display a help window on this test
chart containing the expanded and test information.
\item [{Tabs}] that allow you to change the work form: Contacts (platform
of photocell), Encoder and Server.
\item [{Test}] type with the functionality of executing each of the tests
on the tab or active labor module.
\item [{Viewing~and~editing~the~tests}] shows different selectors for
viewing and editing the jumps and runs. User Notification displays
information about the last action.
\end{description}

\end{figure}



\section{Chronojump Menu}

In the following pictures you can see the drop down menu of the program.
\begin{description}
\item [{Session~Menu}] see figure \ref{fig:menu_session}.
\item [{Mode~Menu}] see figure \ref{fig:menu_mode}.
\item [{Help~Menu}] (Top-right corner of the window) see figure \ref{fig:menu_help}.

\caption{\label{fig:menu_help}Help Menu.}
\end{figure}



\section{Chronopic/s Connection.\label{sec:Conexi=0000F3n-de-Chronopic/s}}

Is possible to connect one or more Chronopics on the menu: \emph{Tools
/ Chronopic}. In Figure \ref{fig:Chronopic-connection} two Chronopics
connected are shown. There is a help button for the ports by clicking
on the \emph{Help} button window. The connection to the Chronopic
timer is specifically addressed in section \ref{par:Chronopic:-concepto-y-configuracion}.

If the first Chronopic is activated, the first circle will be green.
You can connect more than one to perform tests in Multi Chronopic.
When you select the port, you must click on the right button to make
the connection. In each successful activation the red circles will
become green.

\begin{figure}[p]
\begin{centering}
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{images/chronopic-connection}
\par\end{centering}

\caption{\label{fig:Chronopic-connection}Chronopic connection.}


\noindent \centering{}The figure corresponds to the program Chronojump-in
version for Linux operating system, which are connected with two Chronopics.
\end{figure}



\section{Database: sessions, subjects and tests}

Chronojump stores all data in one database file. Thus, instead of
collecting the information in individual files for each session, all
information is organized in a single file to facilitate the study
of relationships between:
\begin{itemize}
\item sessions
\item people
\item tests (jumping, running, reaction times, pulses (rates), multi Chronopic)
\end{itemize}
All modifications in session, subjects and tests, will be updated
at any time in the database. So there isn\textquoteright t need to
save the information periodically and make data loss to a computer
error. If rare case, the program crash, you wouldn\textquoteright t
lose any data except sometimes the one that is being performed at
the time.


\subsection{Sessions}

The sessions represent situations where the coach or evaluator gathers
many athletes (subjects) for a series of tests. Every time you gather
a group of athletes to be tested in a short space of time (usually
one day), you should create a new session. Although the subjects to
assess are the same as in other session, you should create a new one
to keep adding subjects and tests in an old session. In this way,
you can make comparisons between data.

Figures \ref{fig:Nueva-sesi=0000F3n.-Alumnos} and \ref{fig:Nueva-sesi=0000F3n.-Deportistas}
demonstrate the creation of a session.

\begin{figure}[h]
\noindent \begin{centering}
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{images/nueva_sesion_colegio}
\par\end{centering}

\caption{\label{fig:Nueva-sesi=0000F3n.-Alumnos}New Session. School students.}
\end{figure}


\begin{figure}[h]
\noindent \begin{centering}
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{images/nueva_sesion_artistica_competicion}
\par\end{centering}

\caption{\label{fig:Nueva-sesi=0000F3n.-Deportistas}New Session. Rhythmic
competitors.}
\end{figure}



\subsubsection{Creation}

Click on the menu \emph{Session menu / Create session} and one window
will be opened where you must enter the name of the session, the date
and the sport practiced. Optionally you can also indicate the place
where is done and even add comments.


\subsubsection{Load}

If you want to load a session already created to study, add subjects
and / or to test, click on the \emph{Session menu / Load session}.
It will show a list of sessions created and information of the subjects
enrolled in each of them and the tests performed.


\subsubsection{Edición}

Click on \emph{Session menu / Edit session} to modify the parameters
that have been inserted earlier. Normally, it\textquoteright s used
the edition of sessions to add comments about the evolution.


\subsubsection{Delete}

To delete a \textbf{session and all tests} performed, click on the
\emph{Session menu / Remove session}. A confirmation window will appear. 


\subsection{subjects}

All individuals able to perform the tests are known as subject. It\textquoteright s
strongly recommended to create one subject only once in order to study
the evolution over time. In following sessions the subject must be
loaded.

Figure \ref{fig:Creaci=0000F3n-de-un-sujeto} shows the creation of
a person.

\begin{figure}[h]
\noindent \begin{centering}
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{\string"images/Captura-Nuevo saltador\string".png}
\par\end{centering}

\caption{\label{fig:Creaci=0000F3n-de-un-sujeto}Creation of a person.}
\end{figure}



\subsubsection{Current person}

The subject on the left side of the main window is known as \emph{current
person}. All tests done shall be linked to that subject. The latter
subject created or loaded is assigned as current person. 

Tests shall not start until the current person is assigned.


\subsubsection{Creation}

Click on the \emph{Person menu / Create person} or use the Create
button to create a person. You may indicate the full name, gender,
date of birth, height, weight, country, sport, mode and level. It\textquoteright s
important to enter the full name to avoid further conflicts with other
different subjects.

In order to accelerate the creation of multiple subjects, click on
the menu \emph{Subject / Create subjects {[}multiple{]}}. A window
will appear where you can create multiple subjects at once. You can
choose between \emph{Add entries from CSV (spreadsheet)} or \emph{Add
entries manually}.

In the first case you will need a coma separated value file (.csv)
previously created with the information of the name, surname, genre
and weight in diferent fields. The format of the file can be specified
with headers \includegraphics[scale=0.75]{images/import_headers}
or without it \includegraphics[scale=0.75]{images/import_no_headers}.
Additionally you can have a file with a single column for the full
name \includegraphics[scale=0.75]{images/import_1_field} or two columns
for the name and surname \includegraphics[scale=0.75]{images/import_2_fields}.

In the second case, you can create manually a set of subjects as shown
in the figure.

Once created, if you still want to create more subjects, you can click
again on the same menu item. Figure \ref{fig:Creation of multiple subjects}
shows the creation of 11 subjects at once.

\begin{figure}[H]
\noindent \begin{centering}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{\string"images/Captura-Cargar atletas\string".png}
\par\end{centering}

\caption{\label{fig:Creation of multiple subjects}Load subjects.}
\end{figure}



\subsubsection{Load}

If a person has participated in another session, and you want to evaluate
him/her again in the current session, click on \emph{Load person},
and enter the same subject to the new session. The program will distinguish
between tests (jump, run, reaction times and rhythms) made by the
same person in two or more sessions.

If you created a session and you want to continue with the same person/s
in another session click \emph{Load subjects from another session}
and check all subjects who participated in the other session or multiple
session. If you wish you can always discard any subject.

Figures \ref{fig:Cargar-atletas} and \ref{fig:Cargar-atletas-otra_sesion}
show the load of subjects.

\begin{figure}[H]
\noindent \begin{centering}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{\string"images/Captura-Cargar atletas\string".png}
\par\end{centering}

\caption{\label{fig:Cargar-atletas}Load subjects.}
\end{figure}

\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{images/Captura-Cargar_atletas_otra_sesion}
\par\end{centering}

\caption{\label{fig:Cargar-atletas-otra_sesion}Load subjects from other session.}
\end{figure}



\subsubsection{View subject tests}

Click \emph{Show all tests of current person }to see all the tests
that this person has done in the different sessions. You can also
select other subjects of the current session.


\subsubsection{Edit}

Click \emph{Edit person} or press \emph{p} (person) to modify the
data that was entered at the same time as the creation. You can also
add comments.


\subsubsection{Delete}

Click \emph{Delete current person} to be removed of the session. This
operation will remove all tests from any person in the current session.
It\textquoteright s important to know that the subject will not be
removed from the database and the tests in other sessions remain intact.

After deleting this subject, another subject will become the \emph{current
person}. Otherwise any test can be provided.


\subsection{Tests}

So far Chronojump manages five types of tests: jumping, running, reaction
times, rhythms and MultiChronopic. Later Chronojump can handle other
tests. These tests are detected by the signals sent by the contact
platform when the subject steps on and off it.

The database stores the tests and links to other data tables.


\chapter{Tests}

At the following text, it describes the management of the all types
of tests allowed in Chronojump software.


\section{Jump tests}

There is basically two types of jumps: simple and repetitive. Chronojump
detect a \textbf{single jump} as one phase of flight. That\textquoteright s
why there are two types of simple jumps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Those who start and finish on the platform (single hop).We obtain
the variable flight time (TF) 
\item Those who started outside the platform (drop from a height or do a
jump before) to fall on the platform and then jump. Variables obtained:
Contact time (TC) (time between reception and takeoff on the platform)
and flight time (TF). Usually jumps will pursue minimum contact time
and maximum flight time as a power indicator.
\end{enumerate}
A \textbf{multiple jump} (also called reactive) is when you obtain
more than one flight time. For example: make two consecutive jumps
initiated on the platform in the order TF, TC, TF or start outside
the platform and continue with the order TC, TF, TC, TF.

Assuming that the body during the takeoff position is the same as
in the landing, the flight time indicatives the height of center of
gravity of the athlete in this jump.

Videotutorial: Right execution of the Bosco Tests \url{https://youtu.be/wa6-KgTOwkw}


\subsection{Simple jumps execution}

From the Simple Jumps button, you can select from the drop-down list
the following options:
\begin{itemize}
\item Free, normal jump without restriccions
\item \emph{SJ}, Squat Jump
\item \emph{SJ}l, Squat Jump with extra load (extra weight)
\item \emph{CMJ}, countermovement jump
\item CMJl, coutermovement jump with extra load (extra weight)
\item \emph{ABK}, jump with arms Abalakov
\item \emph{ABKl}, jump with arms Abalakov with extra load (extra weight)
\item \emph{D}Ja, drop jump with arms using
\item DJna, drop jump without arms using
\item \emph{Rocket,} Rocket Jump is simple jump similar to the squat jump
but it starts with a full flexion of the legs.
\item \emph{TakeOff}, only records the contact time
\item \emph{TakeOffWeight}, take off with extra load. It only records the
contact time
\item \emph{slCMJleft}, left leg countermovement jump.
\item \emph{slCMJright}, right leg countermovement jump.
\end{itemize}
Sometimes you will be asked to provide additional information as the
extra weight of the subject (SJL) or the height of the drop (DJ). 

The original protocol of Bosco for the \emph{DJ} test indicates that
the arms don\textquoteright t participate in the jump. Instead many
coaches ask their athletes to use the arms because is more similar
to the techniques used in sports. The original \emph{DJ} is called
\emph{DJna} (no arms), while the \emph{DJ} with arms is called \emph{DJ}a.
When you start a DJ test, the program will ask whether to use arms
or not and automatically appoint the jump properly.

If Chronopic has not been connected and activated from Chronopic window,
a jump will be simulated. In the other hand, if Chronopic is connected,
real jump will be done. Note that for some jumps the athlete should
be on the platform, while other jumps it\textquoteright s essential
to be elsewhere. You will be notified if the athlete's situation is
not correct. The progress barr shows the progress of the jump, which
may be stopped by clicking on the \emph{Finish} or \emph{Cancel} button.


\subsubsection{Automatic mode}

In order to accelerate the process of testing multiple subjects you
can click on the \emph{Automatic mode} button. This mode allows you
to perform tests creating or loading sequences of diferent jumps or
people.

Defining the sequence can be done either loading a preconfigured one
(\emph{Load sequence}) or creating a new one (\emph{Create new sequence).}

When a new sequence is created the order of the test must be defined.
There are three different options:
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{By persons}: Each person of the session performs all the tests
before changing to the next person. Example: \emph{Chronojump profile}.
\item \emph{By tests}: Each test in the sequence is perfomed by all the
people in the session before changing to the next test. Example: \emph{Bilateral
profile by persons}
\item \emph{By sets}: Each person of the session performs the first set
of tests before changing to the second set of tests. It can be defined
up to 3 different sets of tests. Example: \emph{Bilateral profile
by sets}
\end{itemize}
To define a new sequence click on the type of sequence it is about
to be created and click on the \emph{Next }button. Then, in the new
window, the order of the tests can be defined. If the \emph{By sets}
option was selected, each set must be defined separately.

After defining the sequence, it can be saved clicking on the \emph{Save}
button.

Once the \emph{Next} button is pressed a new windows will show the
whole sequence indicating the order of the person and the test.

When the \emph{Accept} button is pressed the automatic mode is activated.
In this mode the person frame will be disabled and the name of the
next jumper and what test is going to be done will be shown in the
upper left corner of the Capure frame. The selection of the test will
also disappear, not allowing to change

After performing each jump test, the person and the test will change
automatically.

Clicking on the \emph{See order} button\includegraphics{images/automatic_list}
the whole sequence of the test can be viewed.

To skip all the tests of a person and execute it at the end of the
sequence click on the \emph{Skip} \includegraphics{images/automatic_skip}.

To delete a person from the sequence click on \emph{Remove} button
\includegraphics{images/automatic_delete}.

Clicking on the \emph{End automatic mode} will return to the normal
way of work of Chronojump, allowing you to select the person and the
test to be performed.


\subsection{Repetitive jumps execution}

Click in the button on the Repetitive jumping tab:
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{RJ(j)}, Repetitive Jump (jumps) or repetitive jumping limited
number of hops
\item \emph{Rj(t)}, Repetitive Jump (time) or time-limited repetitive jumping
\item \emph{RJ(unlimited}), unlimited repetitive jumping.
\item \emph{RJ(hexagon)}, reactive jump on an hexagon until three full revolutions
are done.
\item \emph{Triple jump}, triple jump starting from a falling height
\item \emph{Unlimited multiple jump with extra load}
\end{itemize}
Sometimes is necessary to provide additional information as the height
of the initial drop, the extra weight or value of the limiting factor
(hops or seconds). Click on \emph{More} to get a list of all the available
of the reactive jumps and execute them clicking OK. The jump menu
also provides access to these actions.

If Chronopic has not been connected and activated from Chronopic window,
a jump will be simulated. In the other hand, if Chronopic is connected,
real jump will be done. Note that for some jumps the athlete should
be on the platform, while other jumps it\textquoteright s essential
to be elsewhere.

If you want to execute the same type of jump to various subjects and
you don\textquoteright t want a button (only available on the tab
more), you can change the subject and use the Last button to allow
another person to perform the same jump.


\subsection{Auditive and visual feedback in repetitive jumps: bells }

In order to add a visual and auditory feedback during execution of
the jumps, you can set values of flight time, contact time, or the
relationship of both. To be shown a red bell (poor performance) or
green (good performance) together with a distinctive sound. Click
on the \textquotedbl{}Bells\textquotedbl{} to configure these actions
as shown in Figure \ref{fig:Campanas---feedback}.

\begin{figure}[h]
\noindent \begin{centering}
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{images/campanas_es}
\par\end{centering}

\caption{\label{fig:Campanas---feedback}Bells - auditive and visual feedback.}
\end{figure}



\subsection{Jumps view}

Simple jumps are shown on the \emph{Jumps} tab and the reactive Jumps
on the \emph{Jump Reactive} tab. In both cases, it\textquoteright s
included a filter for all the possible tests or only a particular
type.

Tests are associated with the jumpers. The order of the tests presentation
of each jumper is chronological so, the last test appears at the end
of the list. It\textquoteright s included a button that allows sorting
the tests by the type of jump and not in chronological order.

All jumps are selected in the view filter. A series of values are
presented at each hop. It\textquoteright s possible to change the
view by accessing at the Preferences (more information in section
\vref{sec:Preferencias}).

You can use the \emph{magnifying glass} button (or press \emph{z})
to facilitate the view of the tests.


\subsection{Jumps edition}

You can add comments to a jump or change the person (if you forgot
to change the current person previously) If you select the desired
jump and click on the Edit button on the selected jump, you can also
find it on the menu, or by pressing the button \emph{e}.

In the reactive jumps, since they are composed of a set of jumps,
this change will affect all the jumps even if only one is selected.


\subsection{Repair repetitive jumps}

Using \emph{Repair selected} button or pressing \emph{r}, you can
add a jump, modify a contact time or flight time or delete a jump.
If a repetitive jump type has been defined to be limited to max \emph{n}
jumps, or max \emph{n} seconds, this conditions will limit the repair
functionality. When this happens, you will find an information text
on the bottom of the window.


\subsection{Jumps delete}

To delete a jump, select it and click the \emph{Delete selected jump}
button. Its equivalent in the menu or press \emph{d} (delete). By
deleting the test you will be asked to confirm it if the delete confirmation
option is activated in the \emph{Preferences} menu (more information
in section \vref{sec:Preferencias}).

Deleting a repetitive jump will delete all it's jumps.


\subsection{Creation of new jump types}

In order to adapt the software to the needs of each user, it has been
included the function: \emph{Add jump type} (on \emph{Jumps} menu).
This allows trainer to define easily and powerully the desired jump
types.

Created jump type will be available on database to be used at any
session, and it will be listed clicking on the \emph{More} button
at the \emph{Jump} or\emph{ Jump repetitive} tabs (depending on which
kind of jump it's created). This new jump type will be also differentiated
on statistics, graphs and reports.

On creation, you should give it a distintive name and classify between
simple or repetitive. If jump is repetitive, then you can limit is
by jumps, time, or leave it unlimited.

The limit by time or jumps options can be defined as a fixed value
or leaved as undefined. If it's defined fixed, all new jumps of this
type will be limited to that value; in the other hand, if the type
is not fixed, user will be asked by limit value everytime a new jump
is done.

Last settings include: start inside or outside the platform, allow
to jump with an extra weight, and add a description to the jump type.
In the figure \ref{fig:Creaci=0000F3n-de-nuevo-tipo-salto} you can
see the creation of new jump type.

\begin{figure}[h]

\end{figure}



\subsection{Examples on creation of new jump types}

Here you can find some examples on creating new jump types. The names
of the types have been invented in this manual. The table \ref{tab:Created-jump-type-examples}
is also useful to understand the different variables.
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{``SJ-N''} Jump like Squat Jump but the hands are on the nape
instead of hips.
\item \emph{``DJ-Rope2''} Jump like Drop Jump but after executing the
Drop jump, person have to jump again doing two turns with the skipping
rope on the air.
\item \emph{``Triple''} Repetitive jump starting outside the platform
and including three jumps.
\item \emph{``50\%fatigue''} Repetitive jump that has to be done until
arriving to 50\% of the person's fatigue. The number of seconds needed
to be fatigued is personal and is known previously by the trainer.
Starts inside.
\item \emph{``RopeUnlimited''} Person has to jump the rope until trainer
(or jumper) decides to finish. Start inside the platfom and can be
done with an extra weight.
\end{itemize}
\begin{table}[H]
\begin{centering}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|}

\end{table}



\section{Runs}

Running can be detected by two kind of devices:
\begin{itemize}
\item platform/s
\item photocell/s
\end{itemize}
On a run test Chronojump detects time between detection devices. If
the run is ``circular'', it can be used a single device (platform
or photocell), in the other circuits, there's a need of more than
one detection device (of any type).

From now on, \emph{device in contact} means that the person is on
the platform or blocking a photocell signal. Is important to note
that the person should never be in contact in more than one device
at the same time.

The figure \ref{fig:Schem-two-plat} shows a drawing of the position
of two platforms to measure run.

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{centering}
\includegraphics[width=1\columnwidth]{images/chronojump_esquema_two_platforms}
\par\end{centering}

\caption{\label{fig:Schem-two-plat}Drawing of two platforms circuit to measure
run.}
\end{figure}


In order to calculate average speed, user will be asked about the
distance between platforms.

Runs can be of two types: simple and repetitive. On Chronojump a \textbf{simple
run} means that there's only one track. There are two kinds of \textbf{simple
runs}:
\begin{description}
\item [{Running~from~stop}] Start on contact in a device and end in contact
in the same or other device.
\item [{Running~with~initial~speed}] Start before the contact, after
a while, a contact is done and chronometer starts, then person leaves
the detection device until it produces contact again. This allows
to measure a run where person has an initial speed.
\end{description}
In both situations, the registered data is the time between one device
and the other, also speed will be calculated.

An \textbf{intervallic run} is a run where there's more than one track,
it should be understanded as ``run along two or more tracks limited
by devices at a fixed distance''.


\subsection{Correction of multiple contacts}

Chronojump allows to fix the situations where the subject activates
the contact device more than once due to different parts of the body
contact the device in different instants. (example: an athlete arrive
to a photocell, makes contact with a hand, ends the contact and after
that make contact with body).

To prevent this type of situations in Menu -> Preferences -> Runs
check \emph{Prevent double contacts}

\selectlanguage{spanish}%
\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{centering}
\includegraphics{images/preferences_double_contact}
\par\end{centering}

\caption{\label{fig:Double-contact}Double contact configuration}
\end{figure}


\selectlanguage{british}%
This dialog box allows to set the minimum time between contacts to
be considered as correct. If the time between contacts is lesser than
the configuration in the dialog Chronojump will act as set in the
selected option (first, average or last)


\subsection{Simple runs execution}

To execute a simple run, click the following buttons on\emph{ Runs}
tab:
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Custom} to run after introduce the track's distance
\item \emph{20m-400m}, to run on the preselected track's distance
\item Agility runs, this tests are available: 20 Yards, 505, Illinois, Shuttle
Run, Zig-Zag test. The figure \ref{fig:Test-de-agilidad-505} shows
the information available on software about the 505 test.
\end{itemize}
\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{centering}
\includegraphics[scale=0.55]{images/chronojump-505}
\par\end{centering}

\caption{\label{fig:Test-de-agilidad-505}505 Agility test.}
\end{figure}


Click on \emph{More} to see all simple runs available, and execute
them clicking \emph{Ok}.

If Chronopic has not been connected and activated from Chronopic window,
a run will be simulated. In the other hand, if Chronopic is connected,
real run will be done. Software allows to start run in contact with
the device or before the contact. On the later situation, time between
starting of the run and contact on the first device is deleted.

In the pop-up window it shows the progress of the run, which may be
stopped by clicking on the \emph{Finish} or \emph{Cancel} button.

If you want to execute the same type of run to various subjects and
you don\textquoteright t want a button (only available on the tab
\emph{More}), you can change the subject and use the \emph{Last} button
to allow another person to perform the same run.


\subsection{Executing intervallic runs}

To execute an intervallic run, click the following buttons on \emph{Intervallic
Runs} tab:

\emph{By tracks}: intervallic run limited by number of tracks

\emph{By time}: intervallic run limited by number of tracks

\emph{Unlimited}: unlimited intervallic run

At som run types, user interaction will be needed, like track distance
and limit factor: tracks or seconds. Click on \emph{More} to get a
list of all the available of the intervallic runs and execute them
clicking OK. The run menu also provides access to these actions.

If Chronopic has not been connected and activated from Chronopic window,
a run will be simulated. In the other hand, if Chronopic is connected,
real run will be done. Software allows to start run in contact with
the device or before the contact. On the later situation, time between
starting of the run and contact on the first device is deleted.

In the pop-up window it shows the progress of the run, which may be
stopped by clicking on the \emph{Finish} or \emph{Cancel} button.

If you want to execute the same type of run to various subjects and
you don\textquoteright t want a button (only available on the tab
\emph{More}), you can change the subject and use the \emph{Last} button
to allow another person to perform the same run.


\subsection{Feedback auditive and visual at the intervallic runs: bells}

Similarly to the repetitive jumps, you can configure minimum and maximum
values dor each track. A red bell will be shown on a bad execution,
and a green bell on the opposite, also a distintive sound will be
played.

Configure this actions clicking on ``Bells''.


\subsection{Runs view}

Simple runs are shown on the \emph{Run} tab and the intervallic runs
on the \emph{Run intervallic} tab. In both cases, it\textquoteright s
included a filter for all the possible runs or only a particular type.

Tests are associated with the runners. The shown order of the tests
of each jumper is chronological so, the last test appears at the end
of the list. It\textquoteright s included a button that allows sorting
the tests by the type of run and not in chronological order. 

It\textquoteright s possible to change tests view by accessing at
the Preferences (more information in section \vref{sec:Preferencias}).

You can use the \emph{magnifying glass} button (or press \emph{z})
to facilitate the view of the tests.


\subsection{Runs edition}

You can add comments to a run or change the person (if you forgot
to change the current person previously) If you select the desired
run and click on the \emph{Edit} button on the selected run, you can
also find it on the menu, or by pressing the button \emph{e}.

In the intervallic runs, since they are composed of a set of runs,
this change will affect all the runs even if only one is selected.


\subsection{Repair intervallic runs}

Using \emph{Repair selected} button or pressing \emph{r}, you can
add a track, modify a time or delete a track. If an intervallic run
type has been defined to be limited to max \emph{n} tracks, or max
\emph{n} seconds, this conditions will limit the repair functionality.
When this happens, you will find an information text on the bottom
of the window.


\subsection{Runs delete}

To delete a run, select it and click the \emph{Delete selected run}
button. Its equivalent in the menu or press \emph{d} (delete). By
deleting the test you will be asked to confirm it if the delete confirmation
option is activated in the \emph{Preferences} menu (more information
in section \vref{sec:Preferencias}).

Deleting an intervallic run will delete all it's tracks.


\subsection{Creation of new run types}

In order to adapt the software to the needs of each user, it has been
included the function: \emph{Add run type} (on \emph{Runs} menu).
This allows trainer to define easily and powerully the desired run
types.

Created run type will be available on database to be used at any session,
and it will be listed clicking on the \emph{More} button at the \emph{Run}
or\emph{ Run intervallic} tabs (depending on which kind of run it's
created). This new run type will be also differentiated on statistics,
graphs and reports.

On creation, you should give it a distintive name and classify between
simple or intervallic. If run type is intervallic, then you can limit
is by tracks, time, or leave it unlimited.

The limit by tracks or time options can be defined as a fixed value
or leaved as undefined. If it's defined fixed, all new runs of this
type will be limited to that value; in the other hand, if the type
is not fixed, user will be asked by limit value everytime a new run
is done.

User can also fix the distances of the tracks. La ventana de creación
de nuevo tipo de carrera concluye con la posibilidad de añadir una
descripción textual. En las figura \ref{fig:Creaci=0000F3n-de-nuevo-tipo-carrera}
y \ref{fig:Creaci=0000F3n-de-nuevo-tipo-carrera-variable} puede observar
la ventana de creación de nuevos tipos de carreras.

Last settings include: fix the distance of the tracks, and add a description
to the run type. In the figure \ref{fig:Creaci=0000F3n-de-nuevo-tipo-carrera}
you can see the creation of new run type.

\subsubsection{Examples on creation of new run types}

Here you can find some examples on creating new run types. The names
of the types have been invented in this manual. The table \ref{tab:Ejemplos-de-tipos-carreras-creados}
is also useful to understand the different variables.
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{``Sprint10''} 10 meters of sprint run.
\item \emph{``SprintShortVariable''} Run below 20 meters, each runner
will have run at a different distance defined by the trainer.
\item \emph{``20{*}5''} 100 meters run in 5 tracks of 20 meters.
\item \emph{``20{*}n''} 100 .Run 20{*}n meters (n tracks de 20 meters).
\item \emph{``40{*}50\%fatigue''} Intervallic run where each person runs
until 50\%fatigue is reached. Time needed to fatigue is individual
and known by trainer. Each track has 40m.
\item \emph{``100{*}?''} Person has to run tracks of 100m until trainer
(or runner) decides to finish.
\item \emph{``2 min of 20-10-7''} Agility run on 3 tracks that have to
be repeated during 2 minutes. First track has 20m, second 10m and
third 7m.

\section{Encoder tests}


\subsection{Safety instruccions for linear encoders}

An encoder is a precise instrument that has to be managed ALWAYS with
care. Please follow this safety instructions.

If you broke your encoder contact us at hardware@chronojump.org


\subsubsection{Safety magnets}

Fix the encoder on iron or metal surface like the weights on a gym.
Note some gym weights are covered with rubber and have not magnet
power. 
\begin{figure}[h]
\noindent \begin{centering}
\includegraphics{images/encoder-manual-images/magnets.jpeg}
\par\end{centering}

\caption{Magnets on a metal surface}
\end{figure}



\subsubsection{Do not release}

Do not release the wire when it is extended because it will return
at high speed and will break.

\begin{figure}[h]
\noindent \begin{centering}
\includegraphics{images/encoder-manual-images/handle.jpeg}
\par\end{centering}

\caption{Wire handle}
\end{figure}



\subsubsection{Handle the carabiner with care}

Allways be careful when manipulating the carabiner. Ensure that it
is well secured in your fingers. A wrong grab could end up with a
broken encoder. When possible, try to put a finger inside the carabiner
to avoid it slipping from your fingers.

\begin{figure}[h]
\noindent \begin{centering}
\includegraphics{images/encoder-manual-images/never_fingers.jpeg}
\par\end{centering}

\caption{Wrong use}
\end{figure}



\subsubsection{Measure wire length}

Measure with care (not pulling with the fingers) the length of the
wire and the maximum range of the analysed movement. Do not do tests
that can exceed the wire length. Note you can fix encoder to a table
or other place if needed. 

\begin{figure}[h]
\noindent \begin{centering}
\includegraphics{images/encoder-manual-images/measure}
\par\end{centering}

\caption{Measure}
\end{figure}



\subsubsection{Perpendicular use}

Perpendicular use: Encoder measures distance, speed and power of the
wire assuming it's perpendicular to the surface. If you pull/push
the wire with an inclination, data will not be accurate and the wire
can be damaged. 


\subsection{Concepts}

This manual briefly describes some concepts. Understanding them is
important to use the software appropriately.


\subsubsection{Database}

Chronojump stores data in one database file. Thus, instead of collecting
the information in individual files for each session, most of the
information is organized in a single file to facilitate the study
of relationships between:
\begin{itemize}
\item sessions
\item subjects
\item exercises
\item repetitions
\end{itemize}
All modifications in session, subjects and exercises, will be updated
at any time in the database. So there isn\textquoteright t need to
save the information periodically. If rare case, the program crash,
you wouldn\textquoteright t lose any data except sometimes the exercise
that is being performed at the time.


\subsubsection{Sessions}

The sessions represent situations where the coach or evaluator gathers
subjects for a series of tests. Every time you gather a group of athletes
to be tested in a short space of time (usually one day), you should
create a new session. Although the subjects to assess can be the same
as in other session, you should create a new one and load them from
the other session. In this way, you can make comparisons between data
over time.


\subsubsection{subjects}

All individuals able to perform the tests are known as subjects. It\textquoteright s
strongly recommended to create one person only once in order to study
the evolution over time. In following sessions the person can be loaded.


\subsubsection{Exercices}

Every time you want to measure, you perform an exercise. Exercise
has a name (e.g. Bench press), an extra weight (e.g. 40Kg), type of
contraction (e.g. concentric), laterality (e.g. both limbs), recording
time (e.g. 45s) and others.


\subsubsection{Sets (formerly signals)}

When the person does the exercise, encoder generates a lot of data
and sends it to the computer. Exercise duration is defined by the
user who manages the software, but can be shortened if wanted. All
the data received is called a \textquotedblleft set\textquotedblright .
This set is saved automatically when capture ends. The set is meaningless,
it doesn't have any information on how many repetitions of the movement
has been done by the person who executed the exercise.


\subsubsection{Repetitions (formerly curves)}

When set is analysed, a number of repetitions are found. This repetitions
have the mechanical data wanted by the evaluator: start, duration,
speed, force, power. The repetitions are detected by the software
automatically following user criteria. Videotutorial: Saving Repetitions
\url{https://youtu.be/MoFKMGGLbdw}


\subsection{Using the encoder}


\subsubsection{Chronojump main windows}

\begin{figure}[H]
\noindent \begin{centering}
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{images/encoder-manual-images/main}
\par\end{centering}

\caption{Main window}
\end{figure}


A) Starting on the top left of main window, there's a menu bar with
session options and help. You should start your work creating a new
session or loading an existing one.

B) Under the menu bar there's Chronopic information: number of Chronopics
connected and the button to manage them. Chronopic is the microntroller
used on Chronojump project to measure from external devices like a
contact platform, photocells or the encoder. Use the Chronopic button
to tell the software how Chronopic is connected.

C) The rest of the left part of the screen is related to subjects.
On the top you can create new subjects or load from another session.
Below you can select the current person and finally, at the bottom
you can edit the person, see all it's tests and delete it.

D) The centre-right part of the screen is for managing the tests (or
exercises). At the top there are two tabs: contacts and encoder. Select
the encoder tab.


\subsubsection{Connecting encoder}


\paragraph{Chronopic windows}

In order to connect the encoder, click on the Chronopic button (\textquotedblleft B\textquotedblright ,
in the above image) and Chronopic window will be opened. On this new
window select \textquotedblleft Encoder\textquotedblright{} and the
port where Chronopic is connected. If you have any problem press the
help button in that window, it has little and useful information.
After Chronopic port has been selected, just close the window.


\paragraph{Encoder configuration}

The next step is the selection of the type of encoder, how it is atached
to the machine and the type of machine used in the exercise.\foreignlanguage{spanish}{}
\begin{figure}[H]
\selectlanguage{spanish}%
\noindent \begin{centering}
\includegraphics{/home/xpadulles/chronojump-docs/images/encoder-manual-images/select}
\par\end{centering}

\caption{Encoder selection}
\selectlanguage{british}%
\end{figure}


Clicking on the ``Select encoder'' button a new window with selfexplanatory
images will open.

Each type of encoder has a diferent set of configurations. Clicking
on the arrow buttons will change the configuration for this type of
encoder

There are three types of encoder:
\begin{itemize}
\item Linear.
\item Rotary friction.
\item Rotary axis.
\end{itemize}
Some configurations need additional parameters as angle, diameter
or inertia momentum. Videotutorial: Capturing on an inclined plane
machine \url{https://youtu.be/s-8Zel1RtGs}


\paragraph{Inertial machines configuration}

The characteristics of the inertial machines make necessary to enter
a set of extra parameters that are being descrived below:\foreignlanguage{spanish}{}
\begin{figure}[h]
\selectlanguage{spanish}%
\noindent \begin{centering}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{/home/xpadulles/chronojump-docs/images/encoder-manual-images/inertial_conf}
\par\end{centering}

\caption{Inertial machines parameters}
\selectlanguage{british}%
\end{figure}


There's three types of inertial configuration
\begin{enumerate}
\item Machines where the subject works against gravity, or in a vertical
movement. Example: squat.
\item Machines where the subject works in a horizontal movement. Example:
lateral displacement.
\item Machines that have a set of pulleys thet makes the movement of the
machine to be a multiple or a fraction of the movement of the subject
with the objective of doubling the resistance offered by the machine.
\end{enumerate}
Below are descrived the needed parameters:
\begin{itemize}
\item Number of anchorages: Some models of inertial machines have more than
one anchorage allowing to change the mean diameter where the rope
is wrapped. Selecting the number of anchorages will add or supress
the options to enter the diameter of each one.
\item Inertia momentum: This is a parameter that depends on each machine
and is reffered to the machine without any extra load. Chronojump
implements a system to calculate the inertia momentum that allows
to config an encoder in almost all type of inertial machines. Follow
the instructions in section \index{5.3.3.2.4} to calcuate the inertia
momentum of your machine configuration.
\item Mass of each extra load: If the inertial machine allows to add extra
loads to augment the inertia momentum, Chronojump will calcule it
from the mass of eache one of this loads. This way, you have to enter
the mass o only one load.
\item Distance center-load: It is the distance between the center of the
extra load and the axis of the inertial machine.
\item Force multiplier factor: This parameter especifies the configuration
of the pulleys set that allows the resistance of the machine to be
a multiple or a fraction of the force that the machine would offer
without the pulleys set.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Calculation of the inertia momentum}

The firs part of this section will explain how to calculate the inertia
momentum (IM) of the disk in an inertial machine. The calculus of
the IM of a disk with attached weights will be discussed in the second
part. In the following link you can see a video of the process.

\href{http://youtu.be/HK1ilOyg5Vs}{Calculing inertia momentum video}


\subparagraph{Inertia momentum of the disk}

To calculate the IM of the bare disk without weights we will use a
reference weight. Remember, although we will use an attached to the
disk weight, the results given by Chronojump in this part of the process
refers only to the disk without any weight.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Put the machine in a any position that makes the disk rests in a vertical
plane.
\item Attach a known weight to known distance from the center of the disk.
This way the disk will be unbalanced and after lifting and living
the weight it will start to oscilate like a pendulus.
\begin{figure}[h]
\noindent \centering{}\includegraphics[scale=0.12]{images/encoder-manual-images/Disk}\caption{Reference weight}
\end{figure}

\item In chrono jump software, with the encoder connected go to Select encoder.
\begin{figure}[H]
\noindent \begin{centering}
\includegraphics{images/encoder-manual-images/select}
\par\end{centering}

\caption{Select encoder button}
\end{figure}

\item Choose type of encoder you will use, and select the Inertial machine
option.
\item In this windows you will be asked for the diameter where the rope
is wrapped and the IM of the machine. Note that in conical machines
this diameter changes continuously as the disk is spinning. We recommend
you to use the mean diameter of the part of the cone where the rope
is wrapping at. 
\begin{figure}[H]
\noindent \begin{centering}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{images/encoder-manual-images/inertial_conf}
\par\end{centering}

\caption{Parameters of the inertial machine}
\end{figure}

\item As you want to know the IM, click on \textquotedblleft Calculate IM\textquotedblright{}
\item Enter the weight (in grams) of the reference load and the distance
(in centimeters) to the center of the disk.
\begin{figure}[H]
\noindent \centering{}\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{images/encoder-manual-images/calculus}\caption{Parameters for calculating the IM}
\end{figure}

\item Pull the weight to approximately 90 degrees position and leave it.
The disk should start oscil ating.
\item Quickly, click on the capture button. You will see the signal sent
by the encoder. Chrnonojump will detect when the machine stops moving
and will return the calculated IM.
\begin{figure}[H]
\noindent \centering{}\includegraphics[scale=0.33]{images/encoder-manual-images/oscilation}\caption{Capturing the oscilation}
\end{figure}

\end{enumerate}

\subparagraph{Inertia momentum of the disk with attached weights.}

In the encoder configuration you should enter the distance from the
center of the extra loads to the axis of the disk as well as the weight
of the extra weights. This way in the exercise capture windows you
will be asked for the extra weights that are attached to the disk
as shown in the figure below.

\begin{figure}[H]
\noindent \centering{}\includegraphics{images/encoder-manual-images/capture_inertial}\caption{Exercise capturing with inertial configuration}
\end{figure}


Below the extra loads selection box the total inertial momentum is
shown in Kg{*}cm\texttwosuperior{}

Chronojump uses the next formulae:

$I_{w}=M*d^{2}$

Where:
\begin{itemize}
\item $I_{w}$ is the Inertia momentum that each weigth will add to the
system.
\item $M$ is the mass of the weight.
\item $d^{2}$ is the square of the distance from the center of the disk
to the center of the weight.
\end{itemize}
And the inertia momentum of the disk with the attatched weights

$I=I_{d}+n*I_{w}$

Where:

$I$ is the total inertia momentum. This is the value you must enter
in the chronojump software.

$I_{d}$ is the inertia momentum of the disk calculated in the first
part of this section.

$n$ is the number of weights added to the disk. - is the inertia
momentum of each weight calculated above


\subsubsection{Encoder capture tab}

At this tab you can see six areas: 

\begin{figure}[H]
\noindent \begin{centering}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{images/encoder-manual-images/capture_en}
\par\end{centering}

\caption{Capture tab}
\end{figure}



\paragraph{Exercise}

At exercise area there's the exercise name, information of that exercise
and a button to create a new exercise. Clicking at the information
or at the new exercise creation you will notice there's a selector
called \textquotedblleft Displaced body weight (\%)\textquotedblright .
This selector is important to measure the force and power, because
100\% of body weight is displaced during a jump, but 0\% of body weight
is displaced in a bench press. \textquotedblleft Extra weight\textquotedblright{}
selector is used to input how many Kg are moved (weight bearing is
not considered). Summarizing, weight displacement is calculated like
this:

\[
WeightDispacement=\frac{PersonWeight*DisplacedBodyWeight}{100}+ExtraWeight
\]


The exercise area includes also the contraction type (eccentric-concentric
or concentric), the laterality, the recording time selected, the minimal
height, the feedback bell \includegraphics[scale=0.75]{images/bell_button}
and the recalculate button.


\paragraph{Aquire}

In the acquire area a new set can be captured \includegraphics[scale=0.75]{images/capture_button}
or a previusly captured one can be loaded \includegraphics[scale=0.75]{images/load_signal_button}.

\shadowbox{\begin{minipage}[t]{1\columnwidth}%
Important!: When using inertial machiens, remember always start with
the rope fully unwrapped when you press the capture button. I you
don't do that, you will see that half of the repetitions have a much
smaller range of movement than the other half.

\par\end{center}\selectlanguage{british}%
%
\end{minipage}}

With the Options button \includegraphics[scale=0.75]{images/signal_settings_button}
the following parameters of the capture or loaded set can be adjusted:

\begin{figure}[H]
\noindent \centering{}\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{images/encoder-manual-images/capture_options}\caption{Capture options}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Recording time}. How long Chronojump will be capturing the set
resulting of the exercise
\item \emph{End at n inactivity seconds}. If the encoder don't receive any
movement in the specified time Chronojump will end the capuring process.
\item \emph{Minimal height} is the minimum range of centimetres that a repetition
has. E.g. In a bench press, when person lifts the bar fom r the first
time before starting exercise (weight was in the support), this is
not considered a repetition because it's range of movement is lower
than \textquotedblleft Minimal height\textquotedblright{} defined.
\item \emph{Displayed height}. The scale of the set frame. The optimal value
is the range of the movement in each exercise.
\item \emph{Main variable}. The data displayed in the bars frame. This is
the variable that will be showed during the exercise capturing process
as an instant visual feedback.
\item \emph{Show star and duration of each repetition.} If checked will
show in the repetitions table the instant every repetition starts
and de duration of it.
\end{itemize}
Feedback. This button opens the sound and colour feedback options.

\begin{figure}[h]
\noindent \begin{centering}
\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{images/encoder-manual-images/bells}
\par\end{centering}

\caption{Sound feedback options}
\end{figure}


The load button \includegraphics[scale=0.75]{images/load_signal_button}
of this frame allows to load a set, save set again with a comment
(just write comment in the area and press update), or delete the set.
The load set window is used also to manage all the sets of current
person. Right click on it to change the person who performed the exercise,
add a comment or delete any set of a given person. Videoturotial:
Edit set \url{https://youtu.be/UiZJKbU4OSg}

Recalculate can be used after capturing or loading. When user detects
that some parameter has not been set correctly and wants to perform
calculations of the set again, user can change the selector and press
\textquotedblleft recalculate\textquotedblright{} \includegraphics[scale=0.75]{images/recalculate}.
E.g. 40 seconds squat has been done and the extra weight introduced
was 40Kg but user forgot to add the weight of the lift bar. After
capture, user can change 40Kg to 55Kg and then press \textquotedblright recalculate\textquotedblright{}
in order to have the force and power calculated correctly.


\paragraph{Camera record}

At the right of the exercise frame there is a check box where a web
cam can be activated. If it's active it will be used on encoder capturing.
The resulting video will be attached to the encoder set and can be
watched using a button on set frame.


\paragraph{set frame}

During the capture this frame will show the set sent by the encoder.
Once finished Chronojump will calculate all the repetitions and show
them in the same frame with some basic graphic information.


\paragraph{repetitions frame}

Once set is loaded, captured or recalculated, Chronojump will find
repetitions and write their data on a table. Here you can delete a
repetition, save the selected repetition, save all or export them
to an spreadsheet software. Most users will save only a repetition,
or delete a repetition and the press \textquotedblleft save all\textquotedblright .
This repetitions can be analysed at the Encoder analyse tab.

\begin{figure}[h]
\noindent \begin{centering}
\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{images/encoder-manual-images/save_curve}
\par\end{centering}

\caption{Saving and deleting repetitions}
\end{figure}


To save or delete a repetition just click on the checkbox ``Saved''
of the repetition you want to save or delete.

In excentric-concentric mode, saving a excentreic (concentric) repetition
will also save the corresponding concentric (excentric) repetition
of the exercise.


\paragraph{Bars frame}

The bars frame shows, during the exercise, the main variable in real
time. This way the athlete can have an instant feedback of every execution
of the exersice.

\begin{figure}[h]
\noindent \begin{centering}
\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{images/encoder-manual-images/power_bars}
\par\end{centering}

\caption{Power bars}
\end{figure}


The descending white line in the bar indicates an excentric repetition.
An ascending line, a concentric.

The saved repetitions apears with a framed number below.


\subsubsection{Encoder analyze tab}

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{images/encoder-manual-images/analyze}

\caption{Analyze tab}
\end{figure}


Regarding the data, two things can be analysed: current set \foreignlanguage{spanish}{\includegraphics{images/encoder-manual-images/set_button}}(the
set in the capture tab) or user repetitions \foreignlanguage{spanish}{\includegraphics{images/encoder-manual-images/repetition_button}}.

When \textquotedblleft User repetitions\textquotedblright{} is marked,
then using the \textquotedblleft Select\textquotedblright{} button,
it can be discriminated the active repetitions and the not-active.
The analysis will cover only the active repetitions. Also the \textquotedblleft User
repetitions\textquotedblright{} allow to make comparisons between
subjects (to compare the different subjects in this session), or between
sessions (to compare the evolution of a person during different sessions).

There are five modes of analysis:
\begin{itemize}
\item Individual / Current Set \includegraphics[scale=0.8]{images/encoder-manual-images/analyze_individual_current_set}:
Analysis of all repetitions of the current set.
\item Individual / Current session \includegraphics[scale=0.8]{/home/xpadulles/chronojump-docs/images/encoder-manual-images/analyze_individual_intrasession}:
Analysis of the saved and selected repetitions.
\item Individual / All sessions \includegraphics[scale=0.8]{/home/xpadulles/chronojump-docs/images/encoder-manual-images/analyze_individual_intersession}:
Analysis of all repetitions saved in the selected sessions.
\item Groupal / Current session \includegraphics[scale=0.8]{/home/xpadulles/chronojump-docs/images/encoder-manual-images/analyze_groupal_current_session}:
Analysis of current session and selected subjects.
\end{itemize}
Within each mode there's various types of analysis:
\begin{itemize}
\item Power bars \includegraphics[scale=0.75]{images/analyze_power_button}:
Shows power, peak power, time needed to arrive to peak power and range
of movement.
\item Cross variables \includegraphics[scale=0.75]{images/analyze_cross_button}:
to show relationships between variables like \textquotedblleft Power
/ Load\textquotedblright . Includes the 1RM calculation. Cross variables
is the only analysis that can be done on \textquotedblleft compare\textquotedblright{}
mode. Videotutorial: Power vs Load curve \url{https://youtu.be/mynNxYELja4}
\item 1RM \includegraphics[scale=0.75]{images/1RM_button}: It allows to
make different calculations of the maximum repetitions that can be
performed with different loads. Videotutorial: Chronojump tutorials:
Estimate nRM indirectly \url{https://youtu.be/sd40bI2UQ9c}
\item Side compare \includegraphics[scale=0.75]{images/analyze_sidecompare_button}:
to see a graph of the mechanical variables of different repetitions
all with the same axis.
\item Single repetition \includegraphics[scale=0.75]{images/analyze_singlecurve_button}:
to see a graph of the mechanical variables of a repetition.
\item Neuromuscular profile \includegraphics[scale=0.75]{images/analyze_nmp}:
to see the neuromuscular profile of the three best jumps of a set
of six. At least six jumping repetitions are needed to performe that
kind of analysis.
\end{itemize}
The analysis starts when user click in \textquotedblleft Analyse\textquotedblright .
After a while, a graph and a table will appear, both can be saved
using each save button in the lower right.


\subsection{Encoder settings and preferences}

At preferences there are some options that are more advanced and are
not changed frequently. Clicking at \textquotedblleft Session / Preferences\textquotedblright{}
you will see five tabs, third one is related to encoder.

If you want to do calculations of mechanical parameters only in the
propulsive phase just ensure the parameter \textquotedblleft propulsive\textquotedblright{}
is active. The meaning is the following: In a fast concentric movement
where there's little weight displaced, the brake action of the person
in the final phase of the movement will not be used in the calculations.
Nowadays most coaches prefer this option active because they noticed
that the comparison of mean power between a light weight and a heavy
weight exercise is not fair because the brake phase in the light weight
exercise is related to negative force and the power values get very
low. Then, if \textquotedblleft propulsive\textquotedblright{} phase
is active, only this is used, and not the \textquotedblleft brake\textquotedblright{}
phase.

On \emph{Save repetitions automatically on capture }can be selected
what repetition must be saved when perfoming a new exercise. By default
the repetitions with the best mean power will be saved, but it can
be changed to \emph{Save all} the repetitions or \emph{Do not save
}any repetition of the exercise.

The next options are related to smoothing of the capture and we recommend
to leave them untouched.

In the \emph{1RM prediction,} the method to get the linear regression
can be selected. The exponent in the weight means that the larger
is the mass of the point used the larger is the weight used for the
regression. The function of the weight can be zero (non wighted),
one (linear), two (quadratic) or three (cubic).


\subsection{Examples of encoder use}

At the Gym: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item On the floor, at the side of the weight bar, put a gym weight (not
made by rubber) and encoder on the top of it (attached with the magnets).
\item The plastic hook is attached to weight bar securely, and to encoder.
\item Athlete1 and athlete2 start the warming up slowly and full range of
movement (in a different place) while evaluator prepare the software.
\item Evaluator starts Chronojump software, loads a session prepared the
day before (session parameters and subjects were already introduced).
\item Evaluator connects Encoder-Chronopic to the computer using USB cable.
\item Evaluator selects the port at Chronopic window, at the encoder tab.
\item On main window, go to encoder, capture tab.
\item Select exercise options: bench press, extra weight: 20Kg (10 bar +
10 gym weights).
\item Select athlete1. Click on capture (\textquotedblleft Safe\textquotedblright{}
or \textquotedblleft External\textquotedblright ). See the results
but have no time to analyse them now. set is automatically saved.
\item Select athlete2. Click on capture (\textquotedblleft Safe\textquotedblright{}
or \textquotedblleft External\textquotedblright ). See the results
but have no time to analyse them now. set is automatically saved.
\item Select exercise options (extra weight: 30Kg). Change weight of bar
+ gym weights to 30Kg. Then repeat {[}9{]} and {[}10{]}.
\item Repeat the process every time with 10Kg more until one repetition
cannot be done.
\item Close the software and carefully detach the encoder hook from the
weight bar. 
\end{enumerate}
Later, at home:

Open software.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Load session, select athlete1, load first set, and \textquotedblleft Save
all\textquotedblright{} repetitions.
\item Repeat {[}2{]} for all the sets of Athlete1 and Athlete2.
\item Go to analyse tab. Select User repetitions, compare between subjects,
\textquotedblleft Power / Load\textquotedblright .
\item Use the resulting values to prepare training related to power. 
\end{enumerate}

\section{Other tests}


\subsection{Reaction time}

In order to detect reaction time of the person, there's a need of
an assistant, because Chronojump and Chronopic are still unable to
produce random signals that can be measured accurately.


\subsubsection{Protocol}

Assistant will produce contact in a contact device: push-button, platform,
photocell, ... and at any moment (when athlete is prepared), assitant
will release the contact and instantly the Chronopic green led will
light. At this moment, the athelete will produce contact in another
contact device and green light will be off. The reaction time registered
will be the time between light starts glowing and athelete produces
contact. It's important that athlete doesn't see or hear the assistant.


\subsubsection{Executing reaction time}

To execute a reaction time, have the assitant producing contact in
device, click on \emph{Execute reaction time} and follow the protocol
described above.

If Chronopic has not been connected and activated from Chronopic window,
a reaction time will be simulated. In the other hand, if Chronopic
is connected, real reaction time will be done.


\subsubsection{Reaction times view}

Reaction times are shown on the \emph{reaction time} tab. Tests are
associated with the athletes. The shown order of the tests of each
jumper is chronological so, the last test appears at the end of the
list

You can use the \emph{magnifying glass} button (or press \emph{z})
to facilitate the view of the tests.


\subsubsection{Reaction times edition}

You can add comments to a reaction time or change the person (if you
forgot to change the current person previously) If you select the
desired test and click on the \emph{Edit} button on the selected test,
you can also find it on the menu, or by pressing the button \emph{e}.


\subsubsection{Reaction times delete}

To delete a reaction time, select it and click the \emph{Delete selected
reaction time} button. Its equivalent in the menu or press \emph{d}
(delete). By deleting the test you will be asked to confirm it if
the delete confirmation option is activated in the \emph{Preferences}
menu (more information in section \vref{sec:Preferencias}).


\subsection{Pulses (Simple rhythms)}

A simple rhythm or pulse can be measured on the \emph{Pulse} tab.
On the other hand, if a comple rhythm has to be measured, use a MultiChronopic
as described at \vref{sub:MultiChronopic}\emph{.}

There are two kind of tests:
\begin{description}
\item [{Free}] Person tries to be regular on the freely selected pulse.
Evaluator will decide te moment where the test end.
\item [{Custom}] Person has to follow a predefined tempo. If desired, the
total duration of the test can be defined.\\
Tempo can be defined in one of this ways:

\begin{description}
\item [{seconds}] how many seconds pass between pulsations
\item [{ppm}] how many pulsations per minute
\end{description}

Both methods are interrelated, if eg. seconds value is changed, then
ppm changes. As an example, 0.5 seconds are 120 ppm. Evaluator will
decide what is more suitable.

\end{description}

\subsubsection{Ejecución de pulsos}

Desde la pestaña de \emph{pulso} y con el ayudante sin tocar el pulsador
o plataforma, haga clic en el botón: \emph{Libre}, o en el botón \emph{Personalizado.}

En caso que no este conectado el Chronopic, el programa simulará un
pulso. En la ventana emergente se mostrará la progresión del test,
que podrá ser detenido haciendo clic en el botón \emph{Terminar} o
cancelado con \emph{Cancelar}.


\subsubsection{Pulses view}

Puede usar los botones de \emph{lupa} (o la tecla \emph{z}) para facilitar
la visualización de los tests.

Pulses are shown on the \emph{pulses} tab. Tests are associated with
the athletes. The shown order of the tests of each jumper is chronological
so, the last test appears at the end of the list

You can use the \emph{magnifying glass} button (or press \emph{z})
to facilitate the view of the tests.


\subsubsection{Pulses edit}

You can add comments to a pulse or change the person (if you forgot
to change the current person previously) If you select the desired
test and click on the \emph{Edit} button on the selected test, you
can also find it on the menu, or by pressing the button \emph{e}.


\subsubsection{Pulses delete}

To delete a pulse, select it and click the \emph{Delete selected pulse}
button. Its equivalent in the menu or press \emph{d} (delete). By
deleting the test you will be asked to confirm it if the delete confirmation
option is activated in the \emph{Preferences} menu (more information
in section \vref{sec:Preferencias}).


\subsection{\label{sub:MultiChronopic}Multi Chronopic}

Multi Chronopic allows any type of test that uses two, three or four
independent measurements Chronopics. Remember that for the other tests
it\textquoteright s possible to connect multiple devices to a single
Chronopic, but it\textquoteright s understood that that always have
to be in touch in one or both of them.

Unlike previous tests, Multi Chronopic allows the use of several Chronopics,
each connected to one or more detection devices, so that contact can
be more than Chronopic at a time. Their operating depends on the program
user, but here are some examples: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Static Test running on two platforms: the aim is to assess the tempo
of tread of the left and right foot. It\textquoteright s required
that each Chronopic is connected and independent since the sportsman
is often stepping on both platforms
\item The study of the contact times in a volleyball jump: One foot in each
platform, then both take off at the same time. To know various times
is needed 2 Chronopics platforms and 2 independents ones.
\item Plate Tapping with extra coordinative action: Construction of a device
type detection Plate Tapping, where the tester must touch either side
as quickly as possible with a single hand. Connect a conductive part
to any side and to one Chronopic to record the different times. Moreover,
if the subject should do something with his foot every 3 contacts
we can locate a contact platform on the floor and connect it to a
second Chronopic.
\item Two, three or four athletes do a round trip timed race on a track:
there is placed a platform at the beginning and final of each lane.
A Chronopic will be connected to the beginning and end platform because
a person can\textquoteright t be at both at once. Thus, if there are
4 subjects it will be 4 lanes, 4 Chronopic and 8 platforms. We will
be able to measure the times and speeds of each 4 independently.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Synchronization}

Some of these tests require a synchronization to intend that the various
Chronopics start at the same time. However, in others the synchronization
is not required. In the first three examples cited above, synchronization
is required so there is no error in the comparison of time between
a tread and the other (example 1 and 2) or from contact with the tapping
and the tread on the ground (Example 3). This sync can be selected
from a check box and carried out by making contact with several devices
at once, or by touching the Test butto\foreignlanguage{spanish}{n\includegraphics[scale=0.03]{images/test_button}}
of Chronopics. In the Chronojump Forum \url{http://forum.chronojump.org}
is described a method for the construction of a professional sync
device.

The sync in the fourth example requires discussion. If the subjects
leave when they want and the aim is to record only the time between
contact and the next synchronization is not required. On the other
hand, sync is needed if we use the signal of an external evaluator,
and when we expect to know the time between the signal (of any contact)
and the first contact each athlete.


\subsubsection{Erase first time}

In some tests, the time of the first contact until the first change
of state is not relevant.

Perhaps, the subject can begin whenever he wants. If you want to compare
the subject's ability to follow an independent press with both hands
(two Chronopics). The time registered since the start until the first
contact is not relevant and should be removed to avoid contaminating
averages.


\subsubsection{Port configuration}

Obviously, it\textquoteright s imperative to set up two Chronopic
in the window Chronopic: \emph{Tools / Chronopic}, to run the tests
proposed.


\subsubsection{Multi Chronopic results view}

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{centering}
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{images/multiChronopic_mc}
\par\end{centering}

\caption{\label{fig:Gr=0000E1fico-de-multiChronopic_mc}Multi Chronopic screenshot.}
\end{figure}


In the results window, we can observe different columns, if two Chronopic
have been used:
\begin{itemize}
\item Time: The time from the beginning of the test CP1 and CP2
\item State: Information on which change has occur in each Chronopic (if
any) at the time point indicated in the previous column.
\item CP1 and CP2 Change: Time elapsed since the last change of state in
each Chronopic.
\item IN-IN CP1 and CP2: Time elapsed since each Chronopic changed the state
IN until he returned to the same state.
\item OUT-OUT CP1 and CP2: Time elapsed since each Chronopic changed the
state OUT until he returned to the same state.
\item Description: Comments on the particular test run. 
\end{itemize}
In the example in Figure \ref{fig:Gr=0000E1fico-de-multiChronopic_mc}
it shows a Multi Chronopic test duration: 0.928 seconds in which there
are 10 state changes. Multi Chronopic 1, 2, 10n is called so because
is used 2 Chronopics (Chronopics 1 and 2), and has 10 changes. If
we observe the change number 5 it occurs at 0.539 seconds. This represents
a change of status Out Chronopic 1 (no contact) within a (contact).
As indicated in CP1 Change, 0.225 seconds have elapsed since the Chronopic
was in its previous state (Outside) and 0.353 seconds since this was
Chronopic (Inside) as reflected in IN-IN CP1.

Also note that the column IN-IN and OUT-OUT have average values and
standard deviation (SD).

Just as the other tests, the tests are associated with the performers.
The order of presentation of each test in each performer is chronological
so the latter carried out by a subject appears at the bottom of the
list of the tests. You can use the magnifying glass button (or press
\emph{z}) to facilitate the visualization of the tests.


\subsubsection{Multi Chronopic test edition and erase}

You can add comments to a test or change the performer (if you forgot
to change the current subject previously) by selecting the desired
test and click on the \emph{Edit Multi Chronopic} button. It can also
be done in the menu or press \emph{e}.

To delete a Multi Chronopic test, select it and click the \emph{Delete
Multi Chronopic} button selected. Its equivalent in the menu or press
\emph{d} (delete). By deleting the test you will be asked to confirm
it if the delete confirmation option is activated in the \emph{Preferences}
menu (more information in section \vref{sec:Preferencias}).


\subsubsection{Run analysis}

In addition to the examples given we have to include a test to analyze
the run produced by Josep Maria Padullés as part of his doctoral thesis.
As sense devices it\textquoteright s used two photocells barriers
and a track with contacts platforms.

The two photocells are connected to the \textbf{first} Chronopic to
know the time between them. The program evaluator will indicate the
distance between them and thus it can be known the average speed.
The track of platforms will be connected to the \textbf{second} Chronopic,
which will give us the contact time and flight time. In this case
the synchronization between Chronopics or deleted the first time is
not required.

From the data obtained by both Chronopics, you will get the average
speed of the race, and the following data for each of the steps: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Contact times
\item Flight Times
\item Total Time
\item Frequency
\item Amplitude
\item Height
\item Takeoff angle 
\end{itemize}
You can see an example in Figure \ref{fig:Gr=0000E1fico-de-multiChronopic_ra}.
Note that the execution button Running Analysis will be activated
when the distance between the photocells and the two Chronopics are
connected.

\chapter{Statistics and graphics of jumps and races}

Chronojump has multiple indices to study the tests proposed. Unlike
general spreadsheets purpose, the provision of statistical and graphics
has been designed specifically to measure jumps and running. Figure
\ref{fig:Ventana-de-estad=0000EDsiticas} shows the statistics window
that appears when you click on \emph{Tools / Statistics}.

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{centering}
\includegraphics[width=1\columnwidth]{images/chronojump_stats_window}
\par\end{centering}

\caption{\label{fig:Ventana-de-estad=0000EDsiticas}Chronojump statistics window.}
\end{figure}


The current version only provides statistical Chronojump concerning
to jumps. Future versions will also include other statistical tests.
If you have graphics and other statistical tests, we recommend that
you export the worksheet data as described in Section \ref{sub:Exportaci=0000F3n-a-hoja}.


\section{Statistic type, subtype and applications}

Each statistic can be classified by type, among which are:
\begin{description}
\item [{Simple~jumps}] which offers several ways to analyze simple jumps
without contact time.
\item [{Simple~jumps~with~contact~time}] which offers various ways
to analyze simple jumps with contact time.
\item [{Reactive~jumps}] which presents several ways to analyze repetitive
jumps.
\end{description}

\subsection{Simple jumps}

The simple hop statistical show various ways to analyze simple jumps
without contact time, which can be classified into several subtypes:
\begin{itemize}
\item No index
\item Force-velocity
\item Elasticity rate (IE)
\item Use of arms index (IUB)
\item Power peak of Lewis, Harman, Sayers (2), Shetty, Canavan, Lara (5)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{No index}

Statistical simple jump that shows all the jumps or a particular type
as selected on the \emph{application} field.


\subsubsection{Force-velocity}

Statistical simple jump that shows the force-velocity relationship
according to the formula

\noindent \begin{center}
$FV=\frac{SJ+(100\%%)
}{SJ}*100$ 
\par\end{center}

SJ jumps with 100\% extra charge to the body weight, and SJ with no
additional charge.


\subsubsection{Elasticity index}

Statistical simple jump that shows the elasticity index formula

\noindent \begin{center}
$IE=\frac{(CMJ-SJ)}{SJ}*100$
\par\end{center}

between SJ and CMJ jumps.


\subsubsection{Use of arms index}

Statistical simple jump that shows the rate of the use of arms from
the formula

\noindent \begin{center}
$IUB=\frac{(ABK-CMJ)}{CMJ}*100$
\par\end{center}

between CMJ and ABK jumps.


\subsubsection{Substraction between tests}

Statistical tha shows the relative difference between two tests.

\selectlanguage{spanish}%
\noindent \begin{center}
$\%dif=\frac{(test1-test2)}{test2}*100$
\par\end{center}

\selectlanguage{british}%

\subsubsection{Peak power}

Figure \ref{fig:Estad=0000EDsticas-de-saltos-simples} is the ratio
of power peak of the individual authors and their formulas. In the
future, is expected to include expanded documentation for each formula
and literature.

\begin{figure}[h]

\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{images/chronojump_estadisticas_saltos_simples}
\par\end{centering}

\caption{\label{fig:Estad=0000EDsticas-de-saltos-simples}Statistics of simple
jumps.}
\end{figure}



\subsection{Contact time jumps}

The most important in this type of jump is the relationship between
flight time and contact time. In many sports it\textquoteright s necessary
to generate a high power (reflected in the flight time) in a short
time (represented by the contact time). We present two indexes to
study the relation:
\begin{itemize}
\item Dj Index
\item Index Q
\end{itemize}
The application field in both cases refers to the type of jump that
is applied to the statistic.


\subsubsection{\label{sub:=0000CDndice-Dj}Dj index}

Study of the relationship between time of flight / time of contact
in a single jump from the formula

\noindent \begin{center}
$DJindex=\frac{TF-TC}{TC}*100$
\par\end{center}


\subsubsection{\label{sub:=0000CDndice-Q}QIndex}

Study of the relationship between time of flight / time of contact
in a single jump from the formula

\noindent \begin{center}
$QIndex=\frac{TF}{TC}$
\par\end{center}


\subsection{Repetitive jump}

In the repetition of a jump test specified by a number of jumps, time,
or unlimited ends when the coach or athlete decides it. It represents
the evolution of flight time with respect to the contact time in the
different jumps. With this objective are the following statistics: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Average index
\item Power (Bosco)
\item Evolution
\item Mean and standard deviation using RjIndex
\item Mean and standard deviation using QIndex
\end{itemize}
In all cases the application field refers to the type of jump that
is applied to the statistic. 


\subsubsection{\label{sub:=0000CDndice-medio}Average index}

Study of the relationship of flight time / contact time in the repetitive
jump according to the formula 

\noindent \begin{center}
$AverageIndex=\frac{TFmean-TCmean}{TCmean}*100$
\par\end{center}


\subsubsection{\label{sub:Potencia-(Bosco)}Power (Bosco)}

Study of the relationship of flight time / contact time in the repetitive
jump according to the formula 

\noindent \begin{center}
$Power=\frac{9.81^{2}*TFmean*jumps*totalTime}{4*jumps*(totalTime-TFmean*jumps)}$ 
\par\end{center}


\subsubsection{Evolution}

Study of the relationship of flight time / contact time over the repetitive
jump according to the evolution of the formula $Evolution=\frac{TF}{TC}*100$
for each twitching.

Sometimes some athletes do a jump with a very good TF / TC because
of the execution of a low one before or afterwards. For this reason
it has arranged the option to make the best 'n' row to get a selection
of the best range following this index. To the right of this option
you can find the amount of jumps you want to study. If you select
a value of 1 then the best jump will be highlighted. 


\subsubsection{Mean and standard deviation using RjIndex }

Study Index

\noindent \begin{center}
$RjIndex=\frac{TF-TC}{TC}*100$ 
\par\end{center}

for each of the jumps of the repetitive jump test it\textquoteright s
shown the average and standard deviation obtained. 


\subsubsection{Mean and standard deviation using QIndex}

Study Index

\noindent \begin{center}
$Qindex=\frac{TF}{TC}*100$ 
\par\end{center}

for each of the jumps of the repetitive jump test it\textquoteright s
shown the average and standard deviation obtained.


\section{Multisession statistics}

All statistical presented except the Evolution in the repetitive jumps
can be used for the comparison of different jumps or subjects in several
sessions. This will submit a column for each selected session and
facilitates comparison between the different values shown.

It also includes the average and standard deviation of each row displayed.

To access to the statistics multisession click on \emph{session /
selected} and select the sessions you want to use in the window that
appears when you click on \emph{Select}. You can select as many sessions
as desired and is not required to display the current session between
them.


\section{Selection of the jumps to be shown}

There are four selection modes for the jumps shown as a condition
in the generation of statistical expectation:
\begin{description}
\item [{All}] shows the results of the selected statistics.
\item [{Limit~n}] shows the first n selected statistical results.
\item [{Average}] shows the average of each jumper in the selected statistic.
\item [{Max~/s~of~the~jumper}] show \emph{n} maximum values of each
jumper in the selected statistic.
\end{description}
Most of the statistics offers the four options. Those omitted is because
is not a purpose generate them.


\section{Other settings}

Other related action buttons presented below. 


\subsection{Statistics formulation}

All statistics have a statement that is automatically created based
on the selections made by the user in the statistics window. The statement
can help you understand the statistics.


\subsection{Genus distinction}

It presents the option of distinguish between genders for the presentation
of the results. Selecting this option you can have a dual behavior:
\begin{itemize}
\item When the result rows correspond to the statistical index or jumping,
gender selection will lead automatically to the creation of a row
for each of them.
\item When the result rows of statistical correspond to the subjects, it
will appear a letter at the end of the subject to indicate the gender.
\end{itemize}
This button can help intra and inter genus comparisons.


\subsection{Automatic actualization}

The statistics window Chronojump is designed so each change in the
database (new jump, subject rename, delete, jump, change jumper who
has made a jump ...) is updated directly.


\section{Marked rows}

In the first column of each row you will find a small box that allows
you to select whether or not a row is taken into account for the graphs
and reports generated with Chronojump. The first row contains a checkbox
that lets you quickly select and deselect all values. Furthermore,
we show a selection box at the left bottom that allows you to expedite
the selection of rows based on different criteria. For more information
on charts and reports in paragraphs check \ref{sub:Creaci=0000F3n-de-graficos}
and \ref{sec:Generaci=0000F3n-de-Informes} respectively.


\section{Graphic creation \label{sub:Creaci=0000F3n-de-graficos}}

Chronojump can create any graphics of any of the data shown in the
statistics window. To do this simply click on the Graph button that
appears in the statistics window. In the figures \ref{fig:Gr=0000E1fico-stats1},
\ref{fig:Gr=0000E1fico-stats2}, \ref{fig:Gr=0000E1fico-stats3},
\ref{fig:Gr=0000E1fico-stats4} there are some examples of graphics
generated.

\end{figure}



\chapter{Report and export in jumps and races}

We propose two ways to work with raw data using Chronojump. First
of all: \emph{Reporting}, with the utility to create a web page with
the content of the session as well as selected statistics and graphs.
After this: \emph{Export to spreadsheet} data. Export to the tests
program analysis with general purpose spreadsheet (spreadsheet).


\section{Report generation\label{sec:Generaci=0000F3n-de-Informes}}

Reporting on the program Chronojump is the best way to collect information,
statistics and graphs, in one session. This information can be in
one study or with the comparison of various.

Clicking on \emph{View report window} \includegraphics[scale=0.75]{images/report_button},
the figure shown is Figure \ref{sec:Generaci=0000F3n-de-Informes}.
The users have the ability to create a report in web format (HTML)
which can include session data, the subjects who participated and
the tests chosen. Furthermore, using the \emph{Add to report} button
\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{images/report_add}is allowed to prepare
each of the statistics displayed. Do the apparition in the report
generated and the customization that was chosen by the user in the
statistical window. The user can also organize each of the statistics
to do the final report.

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{centering}
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{images/grafico-informe}
\par\end{centering}

\caption{\label{fig:Ejemplo-de-informe}Example of report window preparation.}
\end{figure}


Clicking on \emph{Make Report}, you can choose the filename images/to
save the HTML document. Also, you can generate a folder that will
include all necessary images and styles to display the page properly.

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{centering}
\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{images/report1}
\par\end{centering}

\caption{\label{fig:Ejemplo-de-informe-2}Example of a website report.}
\end{figure}


To print the report, we strongly recommend using the free browser
Mozilla Firefox. In Figure \ref{fig:Ejemplo-de-informe-2} you can
see a photo of a report.


\section{Export to a spreadsheet\label{sub:Exportaci=0000F3n-a-hoja}}

Clicking on \emph{Session / Export session to CSV} to create a CSV
file format (Comma Separated the Values) which can be easily imported
into any spreadsheet program. This file contains the records of all
the tests produced, but it shall not include statistical or graphics.

To export to CSV we chose the semicolon character (instead of comma
character) to separate the different columns of data. Remember to
indicate it when you import the CSV file in the spreadsheet.


\chapter{Share Data Server }

Chronojump has a server to share data between users on Internet. The
server will obtain valuable data from the cross of many variables.
For this, the users may share the data Chronojump. We believe in the
good quality and usability of the technical characteristics of the
server.

Chronojump dispone de un servidor en Internet para compartir datos
entre los usuarios. El servidor permitirá obtener datos valiosos a
partir del cruce de muchas variables, pero para ello es necesario
que exista predisposición por parte de los usuarios de Chronojump
para compartir los datos. Creemos que las características técnicas
del servidor y su usabilidad son óptimas.

\begin{comment}
Creemos que el servidor de Chronojump es óptimo en cuanto a facilidad
de uso-conexión, tiempo en línea, capacidad, funcionalidad, seguridad
y privacidad.
\end{comment}



\section{Share and use the data}

The data that can be shared are the tests, subjects and sessions of
each evaluator at any time. The evaluator may upload to the server
any session, dismissing those athletes and tests that he doesn\textquoteright t
want to share. Before upload the data to the server, check if they
have completed the necessary data from each of the athletes as well
as the data required from the evaluator. 


\section{\label{sec:Calidad-de-los-datos}Data quality. Accredited assessors
and reliable data}

In order to get a lot of data, without sacrificing the quality, there
are two types of data in terms of reliability:
\begin{description}
\item [{The~general~data}] that can be upload from anyone with the Chronojump
technology. This will soon be available for many data that belongs
to this category.
\item [{The~reliable~data}] requires the accreditation of the evaluator
and the justification of the session data. This deals with three different
profiles of the evaluator: 

\begin{description}
\item [{Evaluator-trainer}] profile: person related to the field of training.
\item [{Evaluator-researcher}] profile: person related to the academic
field.
\item [{Mixed~profile:}] person involved in the two areas mentioned above.
\end{description}

The process of accreditation of the assessors has not yet begun, so
all assessors are currently uncredited and the data shared corresponds
to general data. In the future, the new credited evaluators may wish
to upload their data to the reliable data, even if this data has been
uploaded without the accreditation.


The accreditation is in charge of the Research Group: Salut, Activitat
Física i Esport at the Blanquerna Faculty (Universitat Ramon Llull). 

\end{description}

\section{Server functions}

Server functions can be located in the main menu, \emph{Tools / Server}.
Below its described each of them.


\subsection{Check connection}

Allows connecting to the server. If not possible, it may be because
the server is temporarily inoperative, your computer is not connected
to Internet, or your Internet connection has limit on some types of
connection.


\subsection{\label{sub:Datos-del-evaluador}Evaluators data}

This feature allows the evaluator to fill in a sheet which will be
linked to the tests, subjects and sessions that will be shared. The
personal information will be hidden. It\textquoteright s necessary
to provide evaluation data for the following reasons:
\begin{itemize}
\item It\textquoteright s essential for uploading data.
\item Allows knowing the nationalities, ages, equipment, evaluators\dots{}
\item If problems occur with some data, the administrators can contact via
mail to the server of the evaluator.
\end{itemize}
As discussed in Section \ref{sec:Calidad-de-los-datos}, currently
the accreditation is not required, so the sheet that has to be filled
is very short. See Figures \ref{fig:server_evaluador1}, \ref{fig:server_evaluador2}
and \ref{fig:server_evaluador3}. to check the for data window for
the evaluators.

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{centering}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{images/evaluator1}
\par\end{centering}

\caption{\label{fig:server_evaluador1}Details of the evaluator, Tab 1.}
\end{figure}


\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{centering}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{images/evaluator2}
\par\end{centering}

\caption{\label{fig:server_evaluador2}Details of the evaluator, Tab 2.}
\end{figure}


\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{centering}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{images/evaluator3}
\par\end{centering}

\caption{\label{fig:server_evaluador3}Details of the evaluator, Tab 3.}
\end{figure}



\subsection{Upload or update session to server}

This is the most important function to share data. When the evaluator
click on \emph{Tools / Server / upload (or update) session to server},
he must follow this steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item First, the evaluator will be asked to verify the data as described
in paragraph \ref{sub:Datos-del-evaluador},
\item then the evaluator will be asked if he wants to discard some of the
subjects of the session (see Figure \ref{fig:server_include-discard}),
\item then he will be asked for the confirmation,
\item finally it shows a progress window of data to be incorporated into
the server.
\end{enumerate}
\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{centering}
\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{images/Captura-Incluir-Descartar_atletas}
\par\end{centering}

\caption{\label{fig:server_include-discard}Include / Discard subject to the
server. }
\end{figure}


At any time the evaluator can re-upload the session to the server
(update). The data that has already been uploaded will not be included
again, but it wills so, the data created the last time. 

The tests that have been simulated (not obtained from Chronopic) will
be uploaded to the server.


\subsection{Query the server}

It has been created a window that allows average of the simple jumps,
reactive jumps and simple runs. To access to it click on \emph{Tools
/ Server / Query}. The query is performed clicking on the test selectors
and the subject selectors.

Below, we can observe the selectors of the query. Some of them are
mandatory, while the most can be selected on \emph{Any} to indicate
that this variable should not affect the result. 


\subsubsection{Test selector}

Here are the three selectors and possible values:
\begin{description}
\item [{Test~type:}] simple jump test, reactive jump or simple run.
\item [{Test:}] correspond to the type of test described above.
\item [{Variable:}] the average obtained will be different depending on
the test selected:\end{description}
\begin{itemize}
\item For a simple jump test without contact time the only variable is the
\emph{flight time}.
\item For a single jump with contact time, the variables are: \emph{time
of flight, contact time, Index DJ} (see \ref{sub:=0000CDndice-Dj}),
\emph{Index Q} (see \ref{sub:=0000CDndice-Q}).
\item For a reactive jump the possible variables are: \emph{Average Index}
(see \ref{sub:=0000CDndice-medio}) and \emph{Power (Bosco)} (see
\ref{sub:Potencia-(Bosco)}).
\item For the running the only variable is the \emph{time}. 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Selectors on the subject }

The selectors are:
\begin{description}
\item [{Sex}]~
\item [{Age:}] Refers to the age of the subject at the time the test is
made. To calculate the age of the subject it\textquoteright s used
the date of the birth.
\item [{Country}]~
\item [{Sport:}] Sometimes subdivided into specialty.
\item [{Level:}] Divided into: {[}0{]} sedentary or occasional practitioner,
{[}1{]} regular practice, {[}2{]} competition; {[}3{]} elite. 
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Evaluator selector}

Any data from a particular evaluator can be chosen. This option may
be interesting even for yourself because this way is possible to quickly
gather information from all the jumps that have been evaluated.


\subsubsection{Query results}

When you click the search button, after a few seconds the server will
indicate how many results have been found and which is the average.

It is recommended to conduct general searches because the server has
been created recently. As an example of search, try with simple jumps
(Free) with most of the indicators on \emph{Any}.

In Figure \ref{fig:server_query} is an example of consultation.

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{centering}
\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{images/Captura-Query-server}
\par\end{centering}

\caption{\label{fig:server_query}Query the server. }
\end{figure}



\subsection{Server main statistics}

It has been programmed a window to get a snapshot of the existing
data on the server. It shows the number of evaluators, as well as
the subjects and the various type tests. Also indicated which data
has been uploaded by the user who runs the program.

You can access to this window by clicking on \emph{Tools / Server
/ Statistics}.


\section{Web statistics}

The web page \url{http://www.chronojump.org/server.html} shows the
results from the crossing variables updated from the server. These
charts are updated every time new data is included (usually automatically
at night). The aim is to create constantly a set of charts that provide
relevant information to anyone interested, even without using Chronojump.

In Figures \ref{fig:server_graph1}, \ref{fig:server_graph2}, and
\ref{fig:server_graph3} it\textquoteright s possible to check some
examples of graphics that are obtained on the web server. 

\begin{figure}[h]

\par\end{centering}

\caption{\label{fig:server_graph3}Statistics on the web server. Graph relates
flight time, practical level, type of jump and gender.}
\end{figure}



\section{Jumps privacy and confidentiality}

The names and dates of birth of the athletes and the evaluators will
never be shown. Even when uploading the data, the names of the subjects
are not sent (because is not required). The date of birth will be
included to calculate the age, but it will never be displayed. The
comments the evaluator add to the session, subject or test are neither
provided.


\chapter{Preferences of Chronojump}

The preferences window \emph{Session / Preferences}, is divided into
seven tabs \emph{Database}, \emph{Jumps, Runs, Encoder, Camera, Language
and Other.} 


\section{Using Chronojump on more than one computer\label{sec:Preferencias}}

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{centering}
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{images/preferences_database}
\par\end{centering}

\caption{\label{fig:preferences_database}Preferences. Database tab.}
\end{figure}
\emph{Database} tab shows where Chronojump data are, allows to open
the folder, and make one copy of it in a directory of choice for the
users. Maybe it shows two possible locations for the database because
some Windows systems offer a place to store data while the program
runs, and another when it\textquoteright s closed.

Use this tab to have a copy of your data in order to avoid loosing
your sessions, subjects and tests on a hard disk problem or if operating
system is reinstalled. Also you can use this tab to have Cronojump
database in more than one computer.

If you want to copy the data stored in the computer A to the computer
B, follow this steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item On computer A:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Go to: \emph{Session / preferences / database }
\item Select the items you want to backup
\item Click in \emph{Backup database.}
\item Depending on what you have selected to copy, a file or a folder with
its corresponding subfolders will be exported. A directory called
chronojump will be created with all the selected data if you selected
to backup the \emph{Multimedia and encoder tests.} If you didn't selected
to backup the \emph{Multimedia and encoder tests, }a file called \emph{chronojump.db}
will be copied.
\end{enumerate}
\item On computer B:

\begin{enumerate}
\item If Chronojump is not installed, do it.
\item Go to \emph{Session / preferences / database / open database folder}
. A file explorer window will be opened.
\item If you have valuable data on B, then you should make a copy of the
chronojump.db or the Chronojump whole folder that is located two levels
above in the folders hierarchy.
\item Copy the \emph{chronojump folder} or the \emph{chronojump.db} file\emph{
}from A to B.
\item Close chronojump, open again, and it's done.
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Jumps}

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{centering}
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{images/preferences_jumps}
\par\end{centering}

\caption{\label{fig:preferences_jumps}Preferences. Jumps tab.}
\end{figure}


Jumps tab allows to select the information columns that you want to
show in the data windows and statistics window.


\section{Runs}

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{centering}
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{images/preferences_runs}
\par\end{centering}

\caption{\label{fig:preferences_database-1}Preferences. Runs tab.}
\end{figure}


This tab allows to configure the behavior of Chronojump in the running
tests.

The first option refers to the behavior of Chronojump in the firs
contact of a race. It allows to define if the time starts to count
when the first contact occurs (stepping on a platform or a photocell
gate) or at the moment that the contact is over (step off on a platformm
or a photocell gate).

The second option allows you to manage the contacts that are produced
in a short time period.

Example: In a race with a couple of photocell gates separated by 10m,
an athlete, arriving to one of the gates cross it with the hand and
after that with the body with a difference of 20ms. In this case you
could set that contacts separated in the time less than 500ms are
considered as only one.


\section{Encoder}

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{centering}
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{images/preferences_encoder}
\par\end{centering}

\caption{\label{fig:preferences_encoder}Preferences. Encoder tab.}
\end{figure}


This tab allows to config the behavior of Chronojump in the encoder
tests.

The propulsive option is used for calculating for only using only
the part of the movement where the acceleration is superior to gravity,
in other words, when some force is applied.

You can also select the options of automatic repetition save, as well
as the options of the smoothing used in the calculus.

About the 1RM prediction you can select whe method used to weight
the statistical data depending on the load used.


\section{Camera}

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{centering}
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{images/preferences_camera}
\par\end{centering}

\emph{Other} tab has three options. First refers to the number of
decimals (recommended 3). If second option is active, then a confirmation
window will be shown every time that user wants to delete a test.
The last action is specific to the time that limits reactive jumps.
If this option is checked, then a reactive jump limited by time will
accept a jump where the person is in the air in the moment that time
finishes. If is unchecked then this last jump will be rejected.

\begin{comment}
En septiembre de 2007, existe el Chronopic 1.0 y se está desarrollando
Chronopic 2.0, este último en dos versiones: Serial y USB. Además
de la posibilidad de uso del puerto USB, el Chronopic 2.0 es más pequeño
y barato que el 1.0.

\section{Connections in Chronopics serial}

Chronopics serial require external power therefore it should be connected
to a feeder. In addition, these Chronopics requires to be connected
to the computer by a cable. If your computer has serial port, it\textquoteright s
enough with a telephone cable serial. If it doesn\textquoteright t
have USB port, you must convert to USB, it\textquoteright s required
a USB-serial cable or a PCMCIA adapter or with another adapter with
the same functionality. See figure \ref{fig:chronopic1} for an example
of Chronopic1 connection.

Serial Chronopics use 4.5 to 6 volts feeder. Is possible the purchase
of a conventional power supply (which is connected to a power source)
or create a homemade feeder with 3 x 1.5 volts batteries. This option
provides the field tests in Chronopics serials.

With old Chronopics series, the battery connection should automatically
turn the light on even if the Chronopic isn\textquoteright t connected
to any computer. This is a good test to know if the power is working.

If it doesn't work, is recommended to connect the power to the Chronopic
and verify that the light is on (no need of computer) If the light
doesn\textquoteright t turn on, this mean that the failure is in the
Chronopic or in the feeder. Try this again with another feeder or
Chronopic to determine the origin of the failure. The feeder should
be between 4.5 and 6 volts. Some feeders have two polarities, ask
the seller and connect with the correct polarity.


\section{\label{sub:Chronopic-puertos-serie-usb}USB and serial ports}

Chronopic should be connected to the contact platform and the computer.
PC connection is via port as shown in Table \ref{tab:Versiones-de-Chronopic}.

Currently, most laptops do not have a serial port, so the USB port
is required by most users. Users without serial port should get a
pcmcia card or similar type to add serial port to the computer. The
latest and favorite choice is to get a USB-serial cable. In many cities
it\textquoteright s difficult to find these cables in stock if they
haven\textquoteright t been previously requested. Another option is
to buy them online.

The operating system assigns names to ports, as shown in Table \ref{tab:Nombres-de-puerto-USB-y-serie}.

\begin{table}[H]
\begin{centering}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|>{\centering}p{5cm}|}
\hline 
Operating system & Port & Name\tabularnewline
\hline 
\hline 
MS Windows & Serial & \textbf{COM1} or COM2\tabularnewline
\hline 
MS Windows & USB & COM1, COM2, COM3, ... (seen to COM27)\tabularnewline
\hline 
GNU/Linux & Serial & \textbf{/dev/ttyS0} or /dev/ttyS1\tabularnewline
\hline 
GNU/Linux & USB & \textbf{/dev/ttyUSB0}, /dev/ttyUSB1\tabularnewline
\hline 
\end{tabular}
\par\end{centering}

\caption{\label{tab:Nombres-de-puerto-USB-y-serie}Names of each operating
system port.}


\noindent \centering{}The most common names are in bold type text.
\end{table}


The plate-USB Chronopic2 may require a driver if Windows is not able
to detect it. Windows should automatically assign a name (COM1. COM8
..) to the USB port connection, but in many Windows installations
this process is not completed therefore it\textquoteright s required
the driver (According to the manufacturers is not necessary the cable
because is automatically detected). Therefore is recommend to download
a USB-serial driver: \url{http://www.serialgear.com/wd_pl2303h-hx-x_v20019v2021.zip},
or any other provided by the manufacturer or obtained by the network
looking for \textquotedbl{}USB-serial driver \textquotedbl{}.


\section{Chronopic3 assembly process (initial units)}

Chronopic was initially distributed in two parts: the circuit and
the elements that made up the box: methacrylate, screws and washers.
Figure \ref{fig:Chronopic3-assembly-process} shows the assembly.
Note: These instructions are only necessary for the first step of
the assembly process. The latest Chronopic versions are fabric build.
