Chronopic connections
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Chronopic 3 is a USB powered hardware.
 Using USB cable it receives data from PC and also power.
 To complete the connection, this cable will also be connected to the socket.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Chronopic will be connected to the contact platform or photocell barrier
 through the RCA connection
\begin_inset Graphics

	scale 3

\end_inset

 , the terminal block 
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename screw_connector.png
	scale 3

\end_inset

 or both.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using Chronopic RCA (and / or fuse) it is possible to connect 'n' networking
 platforms to any Chronopic.
 This model is useful to chronometer situations where an athlete should
 not be able to be in more than one platform at the same time.
 Both cables of each platform must be connected to the RCA connector or
 the terminal block.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Software allows the connection up to 4 Chronopics with an independent signal,
 each connected to one or more sensing devices.
 This makes possible chronometer independently various subjects, complex
 paces or other applications.
 
\end_layout

Windows USB Driver
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A driver is a small program that indicates the computer how to operate a
 new device.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Chronopic plate requires a driver to run on Windows.
 This driver is automatically installed when you install any version later
 than Chronojump 0.7.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you connect the Chronopic to the computer, and it’s detected "New hardware
 found", then the driver is not required, in other case it will be necessary
 to run the driver.

Modification port assigned by Windows
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the port assigned is COM5 or higher it may cause problems in some computers
 detection.
 If this happen, it’s recommended to assign a lower port than COM5, preferably
 COM1 or COM2.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To manually assign a port, repeat the steps described in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Detección-del-puerto"

\end_inset

 to know which port is assigned, then do the following steps:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Click "Port Settings".
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Click on "Advanced Options".
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Select one of the ports COM1-4 (preferably COM1 or COM2).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Accept and close the assistant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Disconnect the USB cable and reconnect it after a few seconds.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At this point it should be assigned a COM port that device that will last
 forever.
 Alternatively, return to perform the steps described in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Detección-del-puerto"

\end_inset

 to verify that the change was made directly.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
En este momento ya debería tener el puerto COM asignado para siempre a dicho
 dispositivo.
 Opcionalmente, si quiere puede comprobar que el cambio se ha realizado
 directamente puede volver a realizar los pasos descritos en

\begin_layout Section
Chronopic solution problems
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In case of detection failure when changing Chronojump platform, we propose
 the following battery of tests.
 If Chronopic is not working after performing these tests, please noted
 at the Forum 
\begin_inset Flex URL

\begin_layout Plain Layout

http://foro.chronojump.org
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Perform each of the tests until it’s working correctly.
 Remember to check that the cables are connected properly.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Power Problem: The red light will turn on when you connect the USB cable
 (this will happen when the computer is turned on except when there is a
 connected platform and someone stepping on it, or pushing the test button
 
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename test_button.png
	scale 3

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Problem networking platform: Connect the contact platform to Chronopic and
 the Chronopic to the computer (no need to open chronojump)and check the
 Chronopic by clicking on the platform and checking if the light turns on
 and off.
 If the light doesn’t turn on and off, but it did in the previous step,
 then the cables are in touch when they are connected to Chronopic.
 Insulate them, check if they are poorly connected or if the platform has
 a bad contact (disassemble and repair).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Port problem on Windows: If the contact platform doesn’t have any problem,
 unplug it and continue the testing only with the Chronopic.
 Then, check if the port is detected and connect the cables to the computer,
 the power should also be detected in the Chronopic as described in Section
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Detección-del-puerto"

\end_inset

.
 Windows may detect more than one type of port COM, do the following test
 to both.
 If the port assigned is higher than COM4, it’s recommended to modify the
 port to one less than COM4, preferably COM1 or COM2 as described in Section
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Modificación-del-puerto"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Execute Chronojump, select the port configuration in the Chronopic window.
 A dialog will appear asking you to click "OK" and after this click on the
 button Chronopic, shortly Chronopic should be detected and ready to be
 used with the platform connected if desired.

\begin_layout Section
Database: sessions, subjects and tests
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Chronojump stores all data in one database file.
 Thus, instead of collecting the information in individual files for each
 session, all information is organized in a single file to facilitate the
 study of relationships between:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
sessions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
people
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
tests (jumping, running, reaction times, pulses (rates), multi Chronopic)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All modifications in session, subjects and tests, will be updated at any
 time in the database.
 So there isn’t need to save the information periodically and make data
 loss to a computer error.
 If rare case, the program crash, you wouldn’t lose any data except sometimes
 the one that is being performed at the time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Sessions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sessions represent situations where the coach or evaluator gathers many
 athletes (subjects) for a series of tests.
 Every time you gather a group of athletes to be tested in a short space
 of time (usually one day), you should create a new session.
 Although the subjects to assess are the same as in other session, you should
 create a new one to keep adding subjects and tests in an old session.
 In this way, you can make comparisons between data.

Tests
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So far Chronojump manages five types of tests: jumping, running, reaction
 times, rhythms and MultiChronopic.
 Later Chronojump can handle other tests.
 These tests are detected by the signals sent by the contact platform when
 the subject steps on and off it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The database stores the tests and links to other data tables.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter
Tests
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the following text, it describes the management of the all types of tests
 allowed in Chronojump software.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Jump tests
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is basically two types of jumps: simple and repetitive.
 Chronojump detect a 
\series bold
single jump
\series default
 as one phase of flight.
 That’s why there are two types of simple jumps:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Those who start and finish on the platform (single hop).We obtain the variable
 flight time (TF) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Those who started outside the platform (drop from a height or do a jump
 before) to fall on the platform and then jump.
 Variables obtained: Contact time (TC) (time between reception and takeoff
 on the platform) and flight time (TF).
 Usually jumps will pursue minimum contact time and maximum flight time
 as a power indicator.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A 
\series bold
multiple jump
\series default
 (also called reactive) is when you obtain more than one flight time.
 For example: make two consecutive jumps initiated on the platform in the
 order TF, TC, TF or start outside the platform and continue with the order
 TC, TF, TC, TF.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assuming that the body during the takeoff position is the same as in the
 landing, the flight time indicatives the height of center of gravity of
 the athlete in this jump.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Simple jumps execution

\emph default
, left leg countermovement jump.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
slCMJright
\emph default
, right leg countermovement jump.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sometimes you will be asked to provide additional information as the extra
 weight of the subject (SJL) or the height of the drop (DJ).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The original protocol of Bosco for the 
\emph on
DJ
\emph default
 test indicates that the arms don’t participate in the jump.
 Instead many coaches ask their athletes to use the arms because is more
 similar to the techniques used in sports.
 The original 
\emph on
DJ
\emph default
 is called 
\emph on
DJna
\emph default
 (no arms), while the 
\emph on
DJ
\emph default
 with arms is called 
\emph on
DJ
\emph default
a.
 When you start a DJ test, the program will ask whether to use arms or not
 and automatically appoint the jump properly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If Chronopic has not been connected and activated from Chronopic window,
 a jump will be simulated.
 In the other hand, if Chronopic is connected, real jump will be done.
 Note that for some jumps the athlete should be on the platform, while other
 jumps it’s essential to be elsewhere.
 You will be notified if the athlete's situation is not correct.
 The progress barr shows the progress of the jump, which may be stopped
 by clicking on the 
\emph on

\emph default
 or 
\emph on
Cancel
\emph default
 button.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When a new sequence is created the order of the test must be defined.
 There are three different options:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

In order to adapt the software to the needs of each user, it has been included
 the function: 
\emph on
Add jump type
\emph default
 (on 
\emph on
Jumps
\emph default
 menu).
 This allows trainer to define easily and powerully the desired jump types.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Created jump type will be available on database to be used at any session,
 and it will be listed clicking on the 
\emph on
More
\emph default
 button at the 
\emph on
Jump
\emph default
 or
\emph on
 Jump repetitive
\emph default
 tabs (depending on which kind of jump it's created).
 This new jump type will be also differentiated on statistics, graphs and
 reports.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On creation, you should give it a distintive name and classify between simple
 or repetitive.
 If jump is repetitive, then you can limit is by jumps, time, or leave it
 unlimited.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The limit by time or jumps options can be defined as a fixed value or leaved
 as undefined.
 If it's defined fixed, all new jumps of this type will be limited to that
 value; in the other hand, if the type is not fixed, user will be asked
 by limit value everytime a new jump is done.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Last settings include: start inside or outside the platform, allow to jump
 with an extra weight, and add a description to the jump type.
 In the figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On a run test Chronojump detects time between detection devices.
 If the run is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

circular
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, it can be used a single device (platform or photocell), in the other circuits,
 there's a need of more than one detection device (of any type).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From now on, 
\emph on
device in contact
\emph default
 means that the person is on the platform or blocking a photocell signal.
 Is important to note that the person should never be in contact in more
 than one device at the same time.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Runs can be of two types: simple and repetitive.
 On Chronojump a

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Running

\begin_layout Description
Running

speed Start before the contact, after a while, a contact is done and chronometer
 starts, then person leaves the detection device until it produces contact
 again.
 This allows to measure a run where person has an initial speed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In both situations, the registered data is the time between one device and
 the other, also speed will be calculated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An

\begin_layout Standard
An encoder is a precise instrument that has to be managed ALWAYS with care.
 Please follow this safety instructions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you broke your encoder contact us at hardware@chronojump.org
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection

\begin_layout Standard
Allways be careful when manipulating the carabiner.
 Ensure that it is well secured in your fingers.
 A wrong grab could end up with a broken encoder.
 When possible, try to put a finger inside the carabiner to avoid it slipping
 from your fingers.

Perpendicular use
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Perpendicular use: Encoder measures distance, speed and power of the wire
 assuming it's perpendicular to the surface.
 If you pull/push the wire with an inclination, data will not be accurate
 and the wire can be damaged.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Concepts
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This manual briefly describes some concepts.
 Understanding them is important to use the software appropriately.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Database
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Chronojump stores data in one database file.
 Thus, instead of collecting the information in individual files for each
 session, most of the information is organized in a single file to facilitate
 the study of relationships between:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
sessions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
subjects
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
exercises
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All modifications in session, subjects and exercises, will be updated at
 any time in the database.
 So there isn’t need to save the information periodically.
 If rare case, the program crash, you wouldn’t lose any data except sometimes
 the exercise that is being performed at the time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Sessions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sessions represent situations where the coach or evaluator gathers subjects
 for a series of tests.
 Every time you gather a group of athletes to be tested in a short space
 of time (usually one day), you should create a new session.
 Although the subjects to assess can be the same as in other session, you
 should create a new one and load them from the other session.
 In this way, you can make comparisons between data over time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
subjects
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All individuals able to perform the tests are known as subjects.
 It’s strongly recommended to create one person only once in order to study
 the evolution over time.
 In following sessions the person can be loaded.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Exercices
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Every time you want to measure, you perform an exercise.
 Exercise has a name (e.g.
 Bench press), an extra weight (e.g.
 40Kg), type of contraction (e.g.
 concentric), laterality (e.g.
 both limbs), recording time (e.g.
 45s) and others.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Sets (formerly signals)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the person does the exercise, encoder generates a lot of data and sends
 it to the computer.
 Exercise duration is defined by the user who manages the software, but
 can be shortened if wanted.
 All the data received is called a “set”.
 This set is saved automatically when capture ends.
 The set is meaningless, it doesn't have any information on how many repetitions
 of the movement has been done by the person who executed the exercise.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Repetitions (formerly repetitions)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When set is analysed, a number of repetitions are found.
 This repetitions have the mechanical data wanted by the evaluator: start,
 duration, speed, force, power.
 The repetitions are detected by the software automatically following user
 criteria.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
B) Under the menu bar there's Chronopic information: number of Chronopics
 connected and the button to manage them.
 Chronopic is the microntroller used on Chronojump project to measure from
 external devices like a contact platform, photocells or the encoder.
 Use the Chronopic button to tell the software how Chronopic is connected.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
C) The rest of the left part of the screen is related to subjects.
 On the top you can create new subjects or load from another session.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
D) The centre-right part of the screen is for managing the tests (or exercises).
 At the top there are two tabs: contacts and encoder.

\begin_layout Standard
In order to connect the encoder, click on the Chronopic button (“B”, in
 the above image) and Chronopic window will be opened.
 On this new window select “Encoder” and the port where Chronopic is connected.
 If you have any problem press the help button in that window, it has little
 and useful information.
 After Chronopic port has been selected, just close the window.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph

\begin_layout Standard
The next step is the selection of the type of encoder, how it is atached
 to the machine and the type of machine used in the exercise.

 button a new window with selfexplanatory images will open.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each type of encoder has a diferent set of configurations.
 Clicking on the arrow buttons will change the configuration for this type
 of encoder
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are three types of encoder:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Linear.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Rotary friction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Rotary axis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some configurations need additional parameters as angle, diameter or inertia
 momentum.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Chronojump implements a system to calculate the inertia momentum that allows
 to config an encoder in almost all type of inertial machines.
 Follow the instructions in section

\begin_layout Paragraph
Exercise
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At exercise area there's the exercise name, information of that exercise
 and a button to create a new exercise.
 Clicking at the information or at the new exercise creation you will notice
 there's a selector called “Displaced body weight (%)”.
 This selector is important to measure the force and power, because 100%
 of body weight is displaced during a jump, but 0% of body weight is displaced
 in a bench press.
 “Extra weight” selector is used to input how many Kg are moved (weight
 bearing is not considered).
 Summarizing, weight displacement is calculated like this:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
WeightDispacement=\frac{PersonWeight*DisplacedBodyWeight}{100}+ExtraWeight
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The exercise area includes also the contraction type (eccentric-concentric
 or concentric), the laterality, the recording time selected, the minimal
 height, the feedback bell

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To calculate the IM of the bare disk without weights we will use a reference
 weight.
 Remember, although we will use an attached to the disk weight, the results
 given by Chronojump in this part of the process refers only to the disk
 without any weight.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Put the machine in a any position that makes the disk rests in a vertical
 plane.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Attach a known weight to known distance from the center of the disk.
 This way the disk will be unbalanced and after lifting and living the weight
 it will start to oscilate like a pendulus.

After calculating the IM of the disk, you will be asked to enter the number
 of additional weights and the mass of them.
 Chronojump will give you the inertia momentum added by each additional
 weight and the total inertia momentum (disk + weights).
 Chronojump uses the following formulae.
\end_layout

Encoder settings and preferences
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At preferences there are some options that are more advanced and are not
 changed frequently.
 Clicking at “Session / Preferences” you will see five tabs, third one is
 related to encoder.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you want to do calculations of mechanical parameters only in the propulsive
 phase just ensure the parameter “propulsive” is active.
 The meaning is the following: In a fast concentric movement where there's
 little weight displaced, the brake action of the person in the final phase
 of the movement will not be used in the calculations.
 Nowadays most coaches prefer this option active because they noticed that
 the comparison of mean power between a light weight and a heavy weight
 exercise is not fair because the brake phase in the light weight exercise
 is related to negative force and the power values get very low.
 Then, if “propulsive” phase is active, only this is used, and not the “brake”
 phase.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

1RM prediction,
\emph default
 the method to get the linear regression can be selected.
 The exponent in the weight means that the larger is the mass of the point
 used the larger is the weight used for the regression.
 The function of the weight can be zero (non wighted), one (linear), two
 (quadratic) or three (cubic).

Multi Chronopic
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Multi Chronopic allows any type of test that uses two, three or four independent
 measurements Chronopics.
 Remember that for the other tests it’s possible to connect multiple devices
 to a single Chronopic, but it’s understood that that always have to be
 in touch in one or both of them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unlike previous tests, Multi Chronopic allows the use of several Chronopics,
 each connected to one or more detection devices, so that contact can be
 more than Chronopic at a time.
 Their operating depends on the program user, but here are some examples:
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Static Test running on two platforms: the aim is to assess the tempo of
 tread of the left and right foot.
 It’s required that each Chronopic is connected and independent since the
 sportsman is often stepping on both platforms
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The study of the contact times in a volleyball jump: One foot in each platform,
 then both take off at the same time.
 To know various times is needed 2 Chronopics platforms and 2 independents
 ones.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Plate Tapping with extra coordinative action: Construction of a device type
 detection Plate Tapping, where the tester must touch either side as quickly
 as possible with a single hand.
 Connect a conductive part to any side and to one Chronopic to record the
 different times.
 Moreover, if the subject should do something with his foot every 3 contacts
 we can locate a contact platform on the floor and connect it to a second
 Chronopic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Two, three or four athletes do a round trip timed race on a track: there
 is placed a platform at the beginning and final of each lane.
 A Chronopic will be connected to the beginning and end platform because
 a person can’t be at both at once.
 Thus, if there are 4 subjects it will be 4 lanes, 4 Chronopic and 8 platforms.
 We will be able to measure the times and speeds of each 4 independently.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Synchronization
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some of these tests require a synchronization to intend that the various
 Chronopics start at the same time.
 However, in others the synchronization is not required.
 In the first three examples cited above, synchronization is required so
 there is no error in the comparison of time between a tread and the other
 (example 1 and 2) or from contact with the tapping and the tread on the
 ground (Example 3).
 This sync can be selected from a check box and carried out by making contact
 with several devices at once, or by touching the Test butto

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sync in the fourth example requires discussion.
 If the subjects leave when they want and the aim is to record only the
 time between contact and the next synchronization is not required.
 On the other hand, sync is needed if we use the signal of an external evaluator
, and when we expect to know the time between the signal (of any contact)
 and the first contact each athlete.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Erase first time
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In some tests, the time of the first contact until the first change of state
 is not relevant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Perhaps, the subject can begin whenever he wants.
 If you want to compare the subject's ability to follow an independent press
 with both hands (two Chronopics).
 The time registered since the start until the first contact is not relevant
 and should be removed to avoid contaminating averages.

\end_inset

 it shows a Multi Chronopic test duration: 0.928 seconds in which there are
 10 state changes.
 Multi Chronopic 1, 2, 10n is called so because is used 2 Chronopics (Chronopics
 1 and 2), and has 10 changes.
 If we observe the change number 5 it occurs at 0.539 seconds.
 This represents a change of status Out Chronopic 1 (no contact) within
 a (contact).
 As indicated in CP1 Change, 0.225 seconds have elapsed since the Chronopic
 was in its previous state (Outside) and 0.353 seconds since this was Chronopic
 (Inside) as reflected in IN-IN CP1.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to the examples given we have to include a test to analyze the
 run produced by Josep Maria Padullés as part of his doctoral thesis.
 As sense devices it’s used two photocells barriers and a track with contacts
 platforms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The two photocells are connected to the 
\series bold
first
\series default
 Chronopic to know the time between them.
 The program evaluator will indicate the distance between them and thus
 it can be known the average speed.
 The track of platforms will be connected to the 
\series bold
second
\series default
 Chronopic, which will give us the contact time and flight time.
 In this case the synchronization between Chronopics or deleted the first
 time is not required.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From the data obtained by both Chronopics, you will get the average speed
 of the race, and the following data for each of the steps:

The most important in this type of jump is the relationship between flight
 time and contact time.
 In many sports it’s necessary to generate a high power (reflected in the
 flight time) in a short time (represented by the contact time).
 We present two indexes to study the relation:
\end_layout

Chronojump has a server to share data between users on Internet.
 The server will obtain valuable data from the cross of many variables.
 For this, the users may share the data Chronojump.
 We believe in the good quality and usability of the technical characteristics
 of the server.

Chronojump dispone de un servidor en Internet para compartir datos entre
 los usuarios.
 El servidor permitirá obtener datos valiosos a partir del cruce de muchas

Share and use the data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The data that can be shared are the tests, subjects and sessions of each
 evaluator at any time.
 The evaluator may upload to the server any session, dismissing those athletes
 and tests that he doesn’t want to share.
 Before upload the data to the server, check if they have completed the
 necessary data from each of the athletes as well as the data required from
 the evaluator.

Data quality.
 Accredited assessors and reliable data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to get a lot of data, without sacrificing the quality, there are
 two types of data in terms of reliability:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
The
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

general
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

data that can be upload from anyone with the Chronojump technology.
 This will soon be available for many data that belongs to this category.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
The
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

reliable
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

data requires the accreditation of the evaluator and the justification of
 the session data.
 This deals with three different profiles of the evaluator: 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Description
Evaluator-trainer profile: person related to the field of training.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Evaluator-researcher profile: person related to the academic field.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Mixed
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

profile: person involved in the two areas mentioned above.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The process of accreditation of the assessors has not yet begun, so all
 assessors are currently uncredited and the data shared corresponds to general
 data.
 In the future, the new credited evaluators may wish to upload their data
 to the reliable data, even if this data has been uploaded without the accredita
tion.
\end_layout

The accreditation is in charge of the Research Group: Salut, Activitat Física

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This feature allows the evaluator to fill in a sheet which will be linked
 to the tests, subjects and sessions that will be shared.
 The personal information will be hidden.
 It’s necessary to provide evaluation data for the following reasons:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
It’s essential for uploading data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Allows knowing the nationalities, ages, equipment, evaluators…
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If problems occur with some data, the administrators can contact via mail
 to the server of the evaluator.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As discussed in Section

 The query is performed clicking on the test selectors and the subject selectors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Below, we can observe the selectors of the query.
 Some of them are mandatory, while the most can be selected on

\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Variable: the average obtained will be different depending on the test selected:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For a simple jump test without contact time the only variable is the 
\emph on
flight time
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For a single jump with contact time, the variables are: 
\emph on
time of flight, contact time, Index DJ

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Evaluator selector
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Any data from a particular evaluator can be chosen.
 This option may be interesting even for yourself because this way is possible
 to quickly gather information from all the jumps that have been evaluated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Query results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you click the search button, after a few seconds the server will indicate
 how many results have been found and which is the average.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is recommended to conduct general searches because the server has been
 created recently.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
En septiembre de 2007, existe el Chronopic 1.0 y se está desarrollando Chronopic
 2.0, este último en dos versiones: Serial y USB.
 Además de la posibilidad de uso del puerto USB, el Chronopic 2.0 es más
 pequeño y barato que el 1.0.

Connections in Chronopics serial
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Chronopics serial require external power therefore it should be connected
 to a feeder.
 In addition, these Chronopics requires to be connected to the computer
 by a cable.
 If your computer has serial port, it’s enough with a telephone cable serial.
 If it doesn’t have USB port, you must convert to USB, it’s required a USB-seria
l cable or a PCMCIA adapter or with another adapter with the same functionality.
 See figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:chronopic1"

\end_inset

 for an example of Chronopic1 connection.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Serial Chronopics use 4.5 to 6 volts feeder.
 Is possible the purchase of a conventional power supply (which is connected
 to a power source) or create a homemade feeder with 3 x 1.5 volts batteries.
 This option provides the field tests in Chronopics serials.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With old Chronopics series, the battery connection should automatically
 turn the light on even if the Chronopic isn’t connected to any computer.
 This is a good test to know if the power is working.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If it doesn't work, is recommended to connect the power to the Chronopic
 and verify that the light is on (no need of computer) If the light doesn’t
 turn on, this mean that the failure is in the Chronopic or in the feeder.
 Try this again with another feeder or Chronopic to determine the origin
 of the failure.
 The feeder should be between 4.5 and 6 volts.
 Some feeders have two polarities, ask the seller and connect with the correct
 polarity.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Currently, most laptops do not have a serial port, so the USB port is required
 by most users.
 Users without serial port should get a pcmcia card or similar type to add
 serial port to the computer.
 The latest and favorite choice is to get a USB-serial cable.
 In many cities it’s difficult to find these cables in stock if they haven’t
 been previously requested.
 Another option is to buy them online.

The plate-USB Chronopic2 may require a driver if Windows is not able to
 detect it.
 Windows should automatically assign a name (COM1.
 COM8 ..) to the USB port connection, but in many Windows installations this
 process is not completed therefore it’s required the driver (According
 to the manufacturers is not necessary the cable because is automatically
 detected).
 Therefore is recommend to download a USB-serial driver:
